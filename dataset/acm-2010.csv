ACM CCS 2010,"Synchronized aggregate signatures - new definitions, constructions and applications.","An aggregate signature scheme is a digital signature scheme where anyone given n signatures on n messages from n users can aggregate all these signatures into a single short signature. Unfortunately, no ""fully non-interactive"" aggregate signature schemes are known outside of the random oracle heuristic; that is, signers must pass messages between themselves, sequentially or otherwise, to generate the signature. Interaction is too costly for some interesting applications."
ACM CCS 2010,Predictive black-box mitigation of timing channels.,"We investigate techniques for general black-box mitigation of timing channels. The source of events is wrapped by a timing mitigator that delays output events so that they contain only a bounded amount of information. We introduce a general class of timing mitigators that can achieve any given bound on timing channel leakage, with a tradeoff in system performance. We show these mitigators compose well with other mechanisms for information flow control, and demonstrate they are effective against some known timing attacks."
ACM CCS 2010,HyperSentry - enabling stealthy in-context measurement of hypervisor integrity.,"This paper presents HyperSentry, a novel framework to enable integrity measurement of a running hypervisor (or any other highest privileged software layer on a system). Unlike existing solutions for protecting privileged software, HyperSentry does not introduce a higher privileged software layer below the integrity measurement target, which could start another race with malicious attackers in obtaining the highest privilege in the system. Instead, HyperSentry introduces a software component that is properly isolated from the hypervisor to enable stealthy and in-context measurement of the runtime integrity of the hypervisor. While stealthiness is necessary to ensure that a compromised hypervisor does not have a chance to hide the attack traces upon detecting an up-coming measurement, in-context measurement is necessary to retrieve all the needed inputs for a successful integrity measurement."
ACM CCS 2010,Computationally sound verification of source code.,"Increasing attention has recently been given to the formal verification of the source code of cryptographic protocols. The standard approach is to use symbolic abstractions of cryptography that make the analysis amenable to automation. This leaves the possibility of attacks that exploit the mathematical properties of the cryptographic algorithms themselves. In this paper, we show how to conduct the protocol analysis on the source code level (F# in our case) in a computationally sound way, i.e., taking into account cryptographic security definitions."
ACM CCS 2010,PinDr0p - using single-ended audio features to determine call provenance.,"The recent diversification of telephony infrastructure allows users to communicate through landlines, mobile phones and VoIP phones. However, call metadata such as Caller-ID is either not transferred or transferred without verification across these networks, allowing attackers to maliciously alter it. In this paper, we develop PinDr0p, a mechanism to assist users in determining call provenance - the source and the path taken by a call. Our techniques detect and measure single-ended audio features to identify all of the applied voice codecs, calculate packet loss and noise profiles, while remaining agnostic to characteristics of the speaker's voice (as this may legitimately change when interacting with a large organization). In the absence of verifiable call metadata, these features in combination with machine learning allow us to determine the traversal of a call through as many as three different providers (e.g., cellular, then VoIP, then PSTN and all combinations and subsets thereof) with 91.6% accuracy. Moreover, we show that once we identify and characterize the networks traversed, we can create detailed fingerprints for a call source. Using these fingerprints we show that we are able to distinguish between calls made using specific PSTN, cellular, Vonage, Skype and other hard and soft phones from locations across the world with over 90% accuracy. In so doing, we provide a first step in accurately determining the provenance of a call."
ACM CCS 2010,A methodology for empirical analysis of permission-based security models and its application to android.,"Permission-based security models provide controlled access to various system resources. The expressiveness of the permission set plays an important role in providing the right level of granularity in access control. In this work, we present a methodology for the empirical analysis of permission-based security models which makes novel use of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm of Kohonen (2001). While the proposed methodology may be applicable to a wide range of architectures, we analyze 1,100 Android applications as a case study. Our methodology is of independent interest for visualization of permission-based systems beyond our present Android-specific empirical analysis. We offer some discussion identifying potential points of improvement for the Android permission model attempting to increase expressiveness where needed without increasing the total number of permissions or overall complexity."
ACM CCS 2010,Computational indistinguishability logic.,"Computational Indistinguishability Logic (CIL) is a logic for reasoning about cryptographic primitives in computational models. It captures reasoning patterns that are common in provable security, such as simulations and reductions. CIL is sound for the standard model, but also supports reasoning in the random oracle and other idealized models."
ACM CCS 2010,Enhancing resilience of probabilistic key pre-distribution schemes for WSNs through hash chaining.,"We propose, in this paper, a novel class of probabilistic key pre-distribution schemes highly resilient against node capture. We introduce a new approach to enhance resilience by concealing keys through the use of a simple hash chaining mechanism. We provide analytical analysis which shows that our solution enhances the network resilience against node capture without introducing a new overhead comparatively to similar solutions in the literature."
ACM CCS 2010,NoTamper - automatic blackbox detection of parameter tampering opportunities in web applications.,"Web applications rely heavily on client-side computation to examine and validate form inputs that are supplied by a user (e.g., ""credit card expiration date must be valid""). This is typically done for two reasons: to reduce burden on the server and to avoid latencies in communicating with the server. However, when a server fails to replicate the validation performed on the client, it is potentially vulnerable to attack. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically detecting potential server-side vulnerabilities of this kind in existing (legacy) web applications through blackbox analysis. We discuss the design and implementation of NoTamper, a tool that realizes this approach. NoTamper has been employed to discover several previously unknown vulnerabilities in a number of open-source web applications and live web sites."
ACM CCS 2010,TAPS - automatically preparing safe SQL queries.,We present the first sound program transformation approach for automatically transforming the code of a legacy web application to employ PREPARE statements in place of unsafe SQL queries. Our approach therefore opens the way for eradicating the SQL injection threat vector from legacy web applications. This extended abstract is based on our paper[4] that appeared in the Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC'2010) conference.
ACM CCS 2010,Algebraic pseudorandom functions with improved efficiency from the augmented cascade.,"We construct an algebraic pseudorandom function (PRF) that is more efficient than the classic Naor-Reingold algebraic PRF. Our PRF is the result of adapting the cascade construction, which is the basis of HMAC, to the algebraic settings. To do so we define an augmented cascade and prove it secure when the underlying PRF satisfies a property called parallel security. We then use the augmented cascade to build new algebraic PRFs. The algebraic structure of our PRF leads to an efficient large-domain Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and a large-domain simulatable VRF."
ACM CCS 2010,Attacking and fixing PKCS#11 security tokens.,"We show how to extract sensitive cryptographic keys from a variety of commercially available tamper resistant cryptographic security tokens, exploiting vulnerabilities in their RSA PKCS#11 based APIs. The attacks are performed by Tookan, an automated tool we have developed, which reverse-engineers the particular token in use to deduce its functionality, constructs a model of its API for a model checker, and then executes any attack trace found by the model checker directly on the token. We describe the operation of Tookan and give results of testing the tool on 17 commercially available tokens: 9 were vulnerable to attack, while the other 8 had severely restricted functionality. One of the attacks found by the model checker has not previously appeared in the literature. We show how Tookan may be used to verify patches to insecure devices, and give a secure configuration that we have implemented in a patch to a software token simulator. This is the first such configuration to appear in the literature that does not require any new cryptographic mechanisms to be added to the standard. We comment on lessons for future key management APIs."
ACM CCS 2010,Protecting portable storage with host validation.,"Portable storage devices, such as key-chain USB devices, are ubiquitous and used everywhere; users repeatedly use the same storage device in open computer laboratories, Internet cafes, and on office and home computers. Consequently, they are the target of malware that exploit the data present or use them as a means to propagate malicious software., e.g., Conficker and Agent.bz. We present the Kells mobile storage system, which limits untrusted or unknown systems from accessing sensitive data by continuously validating the accessing host's integrity state. We explore the design and operation of Kells, and implement a proof-of-concept USB 2.0 storage device of experimental hardware. Our experiments indicate nominal overheads associated with host validation, with a worst-case throughput overhead of 1.22% for reads and 2.78% for writes."
ACM CCS 2010,Input generation via decomposition and re-stitching - finding bugs in Malware.,"Attackers often take advantage of vulnerabilities in benign software, and the authors of benign software must search their code for bugs in hopes of finding vulnerabilities before they are exploited. But there has been little research on the converse question of whether defenders can turn the tables by finding vulnerabilities in malware. We provide a first affirmative answer to that question. We introduce a new technique, stitched dynamic symbolic execution, that makes it possible to use exploration techniques based on symbolic execution in the presence of functionalities that are common in malware and otherwise hard to analyze, such as decryption and checksums. The technique is based on decomposing the constraints induced by a program, solving only a subset, and then re-stitching the constraint solution into a complete input. We implement the approach in a system for x86 binaries, and apply it to 4 prevalent families of bots and other malware. We find 6 bugs that could be exploited by a network attacker to terminate or subvert the malware. These bugs have persisted across malware revisions for months, and even years. We discuss the possible applications and ethical considerations of this new capability"
ACM CCS 2010,Virtual browser - a web-level sandbox to secure third-party JavaScript without sacrificing functionality.,"Third-party JavaScript offers much more diversity to Web and its applications but also introduces new threats. Those scripts cannot be completely trusted and executed with the privileges given to host web sites. Due to incomplete virtualization and lack of tracking all the data flows, all the existing works in this area can secure only a subset of third-party JavaScript. At the same time, because of the existence of not so well documented browser quirks, attacks may be encoded in non standard HTML/JavaScript so that they can bypass existing approaches as these approaches will parse third-party JavaScript twice, at both server and client side."
ACM CCS 2010,Retaining sandbox containment despite bugs in privileged memory-safe code.,"Flaws in the standard libraries of secure sandboxes represent a major security threat to billions of devices worldwide. The standard libraries are hard to secure because they frequently need to perform low-level operations that are forbidden in untrusted application code. Existing designs have a single, large trusted computing base that contains security checks at the boundaries between trusted and untrusted code. Unfortunately, flaws in the standard library often allow an attacker to escape the security protections of the sandbox."
ACM CCS 2010,Platform-independent programs.,"Given a single program (i.e., bit string), one may assume that the program's behaviors can be determined by first identifying the native runtime architecture and then executing the program on that architecture. In this paper, we challenge the notion that programs run on a single architecture by developing techniques that automatically create a single program string that a) runs on different architectures, and b) potentially has different behaviors depending upon which architecture it runs on. At a high level, a primary security implication is that any program analysis done on a program must only be considered valid for the assumed architecture. Our techniques also introduce a new type of steganography that hides execution behaviors. In order to demonstrate our techniques, we implement a system for generating platform-independent programs for x86, ARM, and MIPS. We use our system to generate real platform-independent programs."
ACM CCS 2010,CardSpace in the cloud.,"This paper describes a web based federated identity management system which is based on the user centric approach of the Information Card model, and has been enhanced to remove many of the problems inherent in Microsoft's original design. Furthermore the new design is adapted to interwork with existing SAML 2 federations. Our model supports not only improved user mobility and the aggregation of claims from multiple identity providers (IdPs), but also user authentication via just one of the IdPs without placing any constraints on the authentication mechanism that is used. This is achieved by introducing a new component, the Linking Identity Selector, which allows the user to select multiple cards at service provision time. Users can then use the combined set of credentials to access a wider range of web based resources. We describe our first example application which allows the user to present a credit card, a self asserted card, a hotel loyalty card and a frequent flyer card in order to make an online hotel booking, using voice biometrics for authentication."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure latency estimation with treeple.,"A network latency estimation scheme associates a ""position"" to every peer in a distributed network such that the latency between any two nodes can be accurately estimated from their positions. Applications for these schemes include efficient overlay construction, compact routing, anonymous route selection, and efficient byzantine agreement. We present a new latency estimation scheme, Treeple. Our scheme is different from existing ones in several aspects: Treeple is provably secure, rather than being able to resist known attacks; positions in Treeple are not Euclidean coordinates and reflect the underlying network topology; finally, positions in Treeple are accurate, stable, and can be assigned to peers not participating in the system."
ACM CCS 2010,Symbolic security analysis of ruby-on-rails web applications.,"Many of today's web applications are built on frameworks that include sophisticated defenses against malicious adversaries. However, mistakes in the way developers deploy those defenses could leave applications open to attack. To address this issue, we introduce Rubyx, a symbolic executor that we use to analyze Ruby-on-Rails web applications for security vulnerabilities. Rubyx specifications can easily be adapted to variety of properties, since they are built from general assertions, assumptions, and object invariants. We show how to write Ruby specifications to detect susceptibility to cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery, insufficient authentication, leaks of secret information, insufficient access control, as well as application-specific security properties. We used Rubyx to check seven web applications from various sources against out specifications. We found many vulnerabilities, and each application was subject to at least one critical attack. Encouragingly, we also found that it was relatively easy to fix most vulnerabilities, and that Rubyx showed the absence of attacks after our fixes. Our results suggest that Rubyx is a promising new way to discover security vulnerabilities in Ruby-on-Rails web applications."
ACM CCS 2010,Return-oriented programming without returns.,"We show that on both the x86 and ARM architectures it is possible to mount return-oriented programming attacks without using return instructions. Our attacks instead make use of certain instruction sequences that behave like a return, which occur with sufficient frequency in large libraries on (x86) Linux and (ARM) Android to allow creation of Turing-complete gadget sets."
ACM CCS 2010,Inference and analysis of formal models of botnet command and control protocols.,"We propose a novel approach to infer protocol state machines in the realistic high-latency network setting, and apply it to the analysis of botnet Command and Control (C &C) protocols. Our proposed techniques enable an order of magnitude reduction in the number of queries and time needed to learn a botnet C &C protocol compared to classic algorithms (from days to hours for inferring the MegaD C &C protocol). We also show that the computed protocol state machines enable formal analysis for botnet defense, including finding the weakest links in a protocol, uncovering protocol design flaws, inferring the existence of unobservable communication back-channels among botnet servers, and finding deviations of protocol implementations which can be used for fingerprinting. We validate our technique by inferring the protocol state-machine from Postfix's SMTP implementation and comparing the inferred state-machine to the SMTP standard. Further, our experimental results offer new insights into MegaD's C &C, showing our technique can be used as a powerful tool for defense against botnets."
ACM CCS 2010,Practical leakage-resilient identity-based encryption from simple assumptions.,"We design the first Leakage-Resilient Identity-Based Encryption (LR-IBE) systems from static assumptions in the standard model. We derive these schemes by applying a hash proof technique from Alwen et.al. (Eurocrypt '10) to variants of the existing IBE schemes of Boneh-Boyen, Waters, and Lewko-Waters. As a result, we achieve leakage-resilience under the respective static assumptions of the original systems in the standard model, while also preserving the efficiency of the original schemes. Moreover, our results extend to the Bounded Retrieval Model (BRM), yielding the first regular and identity-based BRM encryption schemes from static assumptions in the standard model."
ACM CCS 2010,Dissecting one click frauds.,"""One Click Fraud"" is an online confidence scam that has been plaguing an increasing number of Japanese Internet users, in spite of new laws and the mobilization of police task forces. In this scam, the victim clicks on a link presented to them, only to be informed that they just entered a binding contract and are required to pay a registration fee for a service. Even though no money is legally owed, a large number of users prefer to pay up, because of potential embarrassment due to the type of service ""requested"" (e.g., pornographic goods)."
ACM CCS 2010,Dissent - accountable anonymous group messaging.,"Users often wish to participate in online groups anonymously, but misbehaving users may abuse this anonymity to disrupt the group's communication. Existing messaging protocols such as DC-nets leave groups vulnerable to denial-of-service and Sybil attacks, Mix-nets are difficult to protect against traffic analysis, and accountable voting protocols are unsuited to general anonymous messaging."
ACM CCS 2010,TEE - a virtual DRTM based execution environment for secure cloud-end computing.,"Cloud computing is believed to be the next major paradigm of computing because it will substantially reduce the cost of IT systems. Ensuring security in the cloud-end is necessary because customers' data are stored and processed there. Previous studies have mainly focused on secure cloud-end storage, whereas secure cloud-end computing is much less investigated. The current practice is solely based on Virtual Machines (VM), and cannot offer adequate security because the guest Operating Systems (OS) often can be easily breached (e.g., by exploiting their vulnerabilities). This motivates the need of solutions for more secure cloud-end computing. This poster presents the design, implementation and analysis of a candidate solution, called Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which takes advantage of both virtualization and trusted computing technologies simultaneously. The novelty behind TEE is the virtualization of the Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM)."
ACM CCS 2010,On the (in)security of IPsec in MAC-then-encrypt configurations.,"IPsec allows a huge amount of flexibility in the ways in which its component cryptographic mechanisms can be combined to build a secure communications service. This may be good for supporting different security requirements but is potentially bad for security. We demonstrate the reality of this by describing efficient, plaintext-recovering attacks against all configurations of IPsec in which integrity protection is applied {\em prior} to encryption -- so-called MAC-then-encrypt configurations. We report on the implementation of our attacks against a specific IPsec implementation, and reflect on the implications of our attacks for real-world IPsec deployments as well as for theoretical cryptography."
ACM CCS 2010,Laptop theft - a case study on the effectiveness of security mechanisms in open organizations.,"Organizations rely on physical, technical and procedural mechanisms to protect their IT systems. Of all IT systems, laptops are the probably the most troublesome to protect, since they are easy to remove and conceal. When the thief has physical possession of the laptop, it is difficult to protect the data inside. Organizations open to the public, such as hospitals and universities, are easy targets for laptop thieves, since every day many people wander in the premises."
ACM CCS 2010,Information security for sensors by overwhelming random sequences and permutations.,"We propose efficient schemes for information-theoretically secure key exchange in the Bounded Storage Model (BSM), where the adversary is assumed to have limited storage. Our schemes generate a secret One Time Pad (OTP) shared by the sender and the receiver,from a large number of public random bits produced by the sender or by an external source. Our schemes initially generate a small number of shared secret bits, using known techniques. We introduce a new method to expand a small number of shared bits to a much longer, shared key."
ACM CCS 2010,On verifying stateful dataflow processing services in large-scale cloud systems.,"Cloud computing needs to provide integrity assurance in order to support security sensitive application services such as critical dataflow processing. In this paper, we present a novel RObust Service Integrity Attestation (ROSIA) framework that can efficiently verify the integrity of stateful dataflow processing services and pinpoint malicious service providers within a large-scale cloud system. ROSIA achieves robustness by supporting stateful dataflow services such as windowed stream operators, and performing integrated consistency check to detect colluding attacks. We have implemented ROSIA on top of the IBM System S dataflow processing system and tested it on the NCSU virtual computing lab. Our experimental results show that our scheme is feasible and efficient for large-scale cloud systems."
ACM CCS 2010,A privacy recommendation wizard for users of social networking sites.,"Privacy is a huge problem for users of social networking sites. While sites like Facebook allow individual users to personalize fine-grained privacy settings, this has proven quite difficult for average users. This demonstration illustrates a machine learning privacy wizard, or recommendation tool, that we have built at the University of Michigan. The wizard is based on the underlying observation that real users conceive their privacy preferences (which friends should see which data items) based on an implicit structure. Thus, after asking the user a limited number of carefully-chosen questions, it is usually possible to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the user's privacy preferences. This model, in turn, can be used to recommend detailed privacy settings for the user. Our demonstration wizard runs as a third-party Facebook application. Conference attendees will be able to ""test-drive"" the wizard by installing it on their own Facebook accounts."
ACM CCS 2010,Assessing trust in uncertain information using Bayesian description logic.,"Decision makers (humans or software agents alike) are faced with the challenge of examining large volumes of information originating from heterogeneous sources with the goal of ascertaining trust in various pieces of information. In this paper we argue (using examples) that traditional trust models are limited in their data model by assuming a pair-wise numeric rating between two entities (e.g., eBay recommendations, Netflix movie rating, etc). We present a novel trust computational model for rich, complex and uncertain information encoded using Bayesian Description Logics. We present security and scalability tradeoffs that arise in the new model, and the results of an evaluation of the first prototype implementation under a variety attack scenarios."
ACM CCS 2010,Detecting and characterizing social spam campaigns.,"Online social networks (OSNs) are exceptionally useful collaboration and communication tools for millions of users and their friends. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, they are also extremely effective tools for executing spam campaigns and spreading malware."
ACM CCS 2010,"Dismantling SecureMemory, CryptoMemory and CryptoRF.","The Atmel chip families SecureMemory, CryptoMemory, and CryptoRF use a proprietary stream cipher to guarantee authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity. This paper describes the cipher in detail and points out several weaknesses. One is the fact that the three components of the cipher operate largely independently; another is that the intermediate output generated by two of those components is strongly correlated with the generated keystream. For SecureMemory, a single eavesdropped trace is enough to recover the secret key with probability 0.57 in 2^{39} cipher ticks. This is a factor of 2^{31.5} faster than a brute force attack. On a 2 GHz laptop, this takes around 10 minutes. With more traces, the secret key can be recovered with virtual certainty without significant additional cost in time. For CryptoMemory and CryptoRF, if one has 2640 traces it is possible to recover the key in 2^{52} cipher ticks, which is 2^{19} times faster than brute force. On a 50 machine cluster of 2 GHz quad-core machines this would take less than 2 days."
ACM CCS 2010,Building efficient fully collusion-resilient traitor tracing and revocation schemes.,"In [8,9] Boneh et al. presented the first fully collusion-resistant traitor tracing and trace & revoke schemes. These schemes are based on composite order bilinear groups and their security depends on the hardness of the subgroup decision assumption."
ACM CCS 2010,Fingerprinting websites using remote traffic analysis.,"Recent work has shown that traffic analysis of data carried on encrypted tunnels can be used to recover important semantic information. As one example, attackers can find out which website, or which page on a website, a user is accessing simply by monitoring the traffic patterns. We show that traffic analysis is a much greater threat to privacy than previously thought, as such attacks can be carried out remotely. In particular, we show that, to perform traffic analysis, adversaries do not need to directly observe the traffic patterns. Instead, they can send probes from a far-off vantage point that exploit a queuing side channel in routers."
ACM CCS 2010,@spam - the underground on 140 characters or less.,"In this work we present a characterization of spam on Twitter. We find that 8% of 25 million URLs posted to the site point to phishing, malware, and scams listed on popular blacklists. We analyze the accounts that send spam and find evidence that it originates from previously legitimate accounts that have been compromised and are now being puppeteered by spammers. Using clickthrough data, we analyze spammers' use of features unique to Twitter and the degree that they affect the success of spam. We find that Twitter is a highly successful platform for coercing users to visit spam pages, with a clickthrough rate of 0.13%, compared to much lower rates previously reported for email spam. We group spam URLs into campaigns and identify trends that uniquely distinguish phishing, malware, and spam, to gain an insight into the underlying techniques used to attract users."
ACM CCS 2010,A new framework for efficient password-based authenticated key exchange.,"Protocols for password-based authenticated key exchange (PAKE) allow two users who share only a short, low-entropy password to agree on a cryptographically strong session key. The challenge in designing such protocols is that they must be immune to off-line dictionary attacks in which an eavesdropping adversary exhaustively enumerates the dictionary of likely passwords in an attempt to match a password to the set of observed transcripts."
ACM CCS 2010,On pairing constrained wireless devices based on secrecy of auxiliary channels - the case of acoustic eavesdropping.,"Secure ""pairing"" of wireless devices based on auxiliary or out-of-band (OOB) - audio, visual or tactile - communication is a well-established research direction. Lack of good quality interfaces on or physical access to certain constrained devices (e.g., headsets, access points, medical implants) makes pairing a challenging problem in practice. Prior work shows that pairing of constrained devices based on authenticated OOB (A-OOB) channels can be prone to human errors that eventually translate into man-in-the-middle attacks. An alternative and more usable solution is to use OOB channel(s) that are authenticated as well as secret (AS-OOB). AS-OOB pairing can be achieved by simply transmitting the key or a short password over the AS-OOB channel, avoiding potential serious human errors."
ACM CCS 2010,Efficient sensor node authentication via 3GPP mobile communication networks.,"Energy efficiency is one of important issues in the resource constrained wireless sensor network. In this paper, we propose the authentication and key agreement protocol that efficiently reduces the overall computational and communication costs in the next generation converged network. The enhanced security procedures are operated through the mobile network in order to maximize the lifetime of the sensor networks and to apply the combined capabilities of both networks."
ACM CCS 2010,DIFC programs by automatic instrumentation.,"Decentralized information flow control (DIFC) operating systems provide applications with mechanisms for enforcing information flow policies for their data. However, significant obstacles keep such operating systems from achieving widespread adoption. One key obstacle is that DIFC operating systems provide only low-level mechanisms for allowing application programmers to enforce their desired policies. It can be difficult for the programmer to ensure that their use of these mechanisms enforces their high-level policies, while at the same time not breaking the underlying functionality of their application. These are issues both for programmers who would develop new applications for a DIFC operating system and for programmers who would port existing applications to a DIFC operating system. Our work significantly eases these tasks. We present as automatic technique that takes as input a program with no DIFC code, and two policies: one that specifies prohibited information flows and one that specifies flows that must be allowed. Our technique then produces a new version of the input program that satisfies the two policies. To evaluate out technique, we implemented it in an automatic tool, called Swim (for Secure What I Mean), and applied it to a set of real-world programs and policies. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that the technique is sufficiently expressive to produce programs for real-world policies, and that it can produce such programs efficiently. It thus represents a significant contribution towards developing systems with strong end-to-end information flow guarantees."
ACM CCS 2010,TASTY - tool for automating secure two-party computations.,"Secure two-party computation allows two untrusting parties to jointly compute an arbitrary function on their respective private inputs while revealing no information beyond the outcome. Existing cryptographic compilers can automatically generate secure computation protocols from high-level specifications, but are often limited in their use and efficiency of generated protocols as they are based on either garbled circuits or (additively) homomorphic encryption only."
ACM CCS 2010,Rendezvous tunnel for anonymous publishing.,"Many anonymous peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems have been proposed in recent years. One problem that remains open is how to protect the anonymity of all participating users, namely, reader, server and publisher. In this work we propose a novel solution for a P2P file sharing system. Our solution provides overall anonymity to all participating users."
ACM CCS 2010,Protecting browsers from cross-origin CSS attacks.,"Cross-origin CSS attacks use style sheet import to steal confidential information from a victim website, hijacking a user's existing authenticated session; existing XSS defenses are ineffective. We show how to conduct these attacks with any browser, even if JavaScript is disabled, and propose a client-side defense with little or no impact on the vast majority of web sites. We have implemented and deployed defenses in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari. Our defense proposal has also been adopted by Opera."
ACM CCS 2010,Exploiting social networking sites for spam.,"In the ongoing arms race between spammers and the multi-million dollar anti-spam industry, the number of unsolicited e-mail messages (better known as ""spam"") and phishing has increased heavily in the last decade. In this paper, we show that our novel friend-in-the-middle attack on social networking sites (SNSs) can be used to harvest social data in an automated fashion. This social data can then be exploited for large-scale attacks such as context-aware spam and social-phishing. We prove the feasibility of our attack exemplarily on Facebook and identify possible consequences based on a mathematical model and simulations. Alarmingly, all major SNSs are vulnerable to our attack as they fail to secure the network layer appropriately."
ACM CCS 2010,Mobile location tracking in metro areas - malnets and others.,"Digital wireless radios broadcast identification numbers that uniquely identify them. As has been previously observed, given the ubiquity with which people carry smartphones with their embedded WiFi radios powered on, comes the ability to track individuals' movements. The ability to use wireless radios for positioning has been previously observed and developed in to useful products. In these systems a user willingly geolocates themselves by providing identifiers to infrastructure hardware. In this paper we consider the converse question: what rates of monitoring by smartphones devices in a given metropolitan area are necessary to achieve different levels of involuntary geolocation. While previous work has looked at countermeasure that attempt to maintain privacy, no work has attempted to quantify the problem and risks. Using appropriate simulations we give the first quantitative support for the number and conditions of tracking devices necessary to track the locations of non-participant individuals in urban environments. We provide evidence that a small, but not insignificant, number of mobile devices can be used to track a majority of users during a significant fraction of their travel with current devices. We conclude that in the immediate future, malnets would require relatively high infection rates to pose a significant threat, but that voluntary networks, with perceived benefit can probably achieve the usage rates necessary to track individual movements of non-subscribed users to a high-degree of accuracy. Our results also suggest ubiquitous deployment of 802.11n in smartphones would make geolocation feasible by malnets"
ACM CCS 2010,An implementation of event and filter confidentiality in pub/sub systems and its application to e-health.,"The publish/subscribe model offers a loosely-coupled communication paradigm where applications interact indirectly and asynchronously. Publisher applications generate events that are forwarded to subscriber applications by a network of brokers. Subscribers register by specifying filters that brokers match against events as part of the routing process. Brokers might be deployed on untrusted servers where malicious entities can get access to events and filters. Supporting confidentiality of events and filters in this setting is still an open challenge. First of all, it is desirable that publishers and subscribers do not share secret keys, such a requirement being against the loose-coupling of the model. Second, brokers need to route events by matching encrypted events against encrypted filters. This should be possible even with very complex filters. Existing solutions do not fully address these issues. This work describes the implementation of a novel schema that supports (i) confidentiality for events and filters; (ii) filters that express very complex constraints on events even if brokers are not able to access any information on both events and filters; (iii) and finally, does not require publishers and subscribers to share keys. We then describe an e-Health application scenario for monitoring patients with chronic diseases and show how our encryption schema can be used to provide confidentiality of the patients' personal and medical data, and control who can receive the patients' data and under which conditions."
ACM CCS 2010,Privacy and robustness for data aggregation in wireless sensor networks.,No abstract available.
ACM CCS 2010,An empirical study of privacy-violating information flows in JavaScript web applications.,"The dynamic nature of JavaScript web applications has given rise to the possibility of privacy violating information flows. We present an empirical study of the prevalence of such flows on a large number of popular websites. We have (1) designed an expressive, fine-grained information flow policy language that allows us to specify and detect different kinds of privacy-violating flows in JavaScript code,(2) implemented a new rewriting-based JavaScript information flow engine within the Chrome browser, and (3) used the enhanced browser to conduct a large-scale empirical study over the Alexa global top 50,000 websites of four privacy-violating flows: cookie stealing, location hijacking, history sniffing, and behavior tracking. Our survey shows that several popular sites, including Alexa global top-100 sites, use privacy-violating flows to exfiltrate information about users' browsing behavior. Our findings show that steps must be taken to mitigate the privacy threat from covert flows in browsers."
ACM CCS 2010,Recruiting new tor relays with BRAIDS.,"Tor, a distributed Internet anonymizing system, relies on volunteers who run dedicated relays. Other than altruism, these volunteers have no incentive to run relays, causing a large disparity between the number of users and available relays. We introduce BRAIDS, a set of practical mechanisms that encourages users to run Tor relays, allowing them to earn credits redeemable for improved performance of both interactive and non-interactive Tor traffic. These performance incentives will allow Tor to support increasing resource demands with almost no loss in anonymity: BRAIDS is robust to well-known attacks. Using a simulation of 20,300 Tor nodes, we show that BRAIDS allows relays to achieve 75% lower latency than non-relays for interactive traffic, and 90% higher bandwidth utilization for non-interactive traffic."
ACM CCS 2010,Designing router scheduling policies - a privacy perspective.,"We examine a queuing side channel which results from a shared resource between two users in the context of packet networks. We consider the scenario where one of them is a legitimate user and the other is an attacker who is trying to learn about the former's activities. We show that the waiting time of an adversary sending a small but frequent probe stream to the shared resource (e.g., a router) is highly correlated with traffic pattern of the user."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure text processing with applications to private DNA matching.,"Motivated by the problem of private DNA matching, we consider the design of efficient protocols for secure text processing. Here, informally, a party P1 holds a text T and a party P2 holds a pattern p and some additional information y, and P2 wants to learn {f(T,j,y)} for all locations j where p is found as a substring in T. (In particular, this generalizes the basic pattern matching problem.) We aim for protocols with full security against a malicious P2 that also preserve privacy against a malicious P1 (i.e., one-sided security). We show how to modify Yao's garbled circuit approach to obtain a protocol where the size of the garbled circuit is linear in the number of occurrences of p in T (rather than linear in $|T|$). Along the way we show a new keyword search protocol that may be of independent interest."
ACM CCS 2010,CRAFT - a new secure congestion control architecture.,"Congestion control algorithms seek to optimally utilize network resources by allocating a certain rate for each user. However, malicious clients can disregard the congestion control algorithms implemented at the clients and induce congestion at bottleneck links. Thus, in an adversarial environment, the network must enforce the congestion control algorithm in order to attain the optimal network utilization offered by the algorithm. Prior work protects only a single link incident on the enforcement routers neglecting damage inflicted upon other downstream links. We present CRAFT, a capability-based scheme to secure all downstream links of a deploying router. Our goal is to enforce a network-wide congestion control algorithm on all flows. As a reference design, we develop techniques to enforce the TCP congestion control. Our design regulates all flows to share bandwidth resources in a TCP-fair manner by emulating the TCP state machine in a CRAFT router. As a result, once a flow passes a single CRAFT router, it is TCP-fair on all downstream links of that router."
ACM CCS 2010,Trail of bytes - efficient support for forensic analysis.,"For the most part, forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we tend to lack detailed information just when we need it the most. Simply put, the current state of computer forensics leaves much to be desired. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromised has been detected."
ACM CCS 2010,Timing attacks on PIN input devices.,"Keypads are commonly used to enter personal identification numbers (PIN) which are intended to authenticate a user based on what they know. A number of those keypads such as ATM inputs and door keypads provide an audio feedback to the user for each button pressed. Such audio feedback are observable from a modest distance. We are looking at quantifying the information leaking from delays between acoustic feedback pulses. Preliminary experiments suggest that by using a Hidden Markov Model, it might be possible to substantially narrow the search space. A subsequent brute force search on the reduced search space could be possible with- out triggering alerts, lockouts or other mechanisms design to thwart plain brute force attempts."
ACM CCS 2010,Accountability - definition and relationship to verifiability.,"Many cryptographic tasks and protocols, such as non-repudiation, contract-signing, voting, auction, identity-based encryption, and certain forms of secure multi-party computation, involve the use of (semi-)trusted parties, such as notaries and authorities. It is crucial that such parties can be held accountable in case they misbehave as this is a strong incentive for such parties to follow the protocol. Unfortunately, there does not exist a general and convincing definition of accountability that would allow to assess the level of accountability a protocol provides."
ACM CCS 2010,AccessMiner - using system-centric models for malware protection.,"Models based on system calls are a popular and common approach to characterize the run-time behavior of programs. For example, system calls are used by intrusion detection systems to detect software exploits. As another example, policies based on system calls are used to sandbox applications or to enforce access control. Given that malware represents a significant security threat for today's computing infrastructure, it is not surprising that system calls were also proposed to distinguish between benign processes and malicious code."
ACM CCS 2010,SecTag - a multi-policy supported secure web tag framework.,"Traditional web application development often encounters tight coupling problem between access control logic and business logic. It is hard to configure and modify access control policies after a system has been deployed. In this demonstration, we present SecTag, a multi-policy supported secure web tag framework, to address this problem. We define a series of general-purpose secure attributes that meet the demand of fine-grained access control in web presentation layer. We also design a set of high interactive secure tags, which encapsulate secure features to provide reusable secure components for web development. A running example of SecTag is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
ACM CCS 2010,Dialog-based payload aggregation for intrusion detection.,"Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) such as Snort or Bro that have to analyze the packet payload for all the received data show severe performance problems if used in high-speed networks. Recent research results improve pattern matchers based on efficient algorithms or using specialized hardware. We approach the problem in a completely different way by considerably reducing the amount of data to be analyzed with only marginal impact on the detection quality. Dialog-based Payload Aggregation (DPA) uses TCP sequence numbers to decide which parts of the payload need to be analyzed by the IDS. Whenever a connection starts, or if the direction of the data transmission between peers changes, we forward the next N bytes of traffic to an attached IDS. All data transferred after the window is discarded. Our analysis using live network traffic and multiple Snort rulesets shows that most of the pattern matches occur at the beginning of connections or directly after direction changes in the data streams. According to our experimental results, our method reduces the data rate to be processed to around 1% in a typical network while retaining more than 98% of all detected events. Assuming a linear relationship between the data rate and processing time of an IDS, this results in a speedup of two magnitudes in the best case."
ACM CCS 2010,BLADE - an attack-agnostic approach for preventing drive-by malware infections.,"Web-based surreptitious malware infections (i.e., drive-by downloads) have become the primary method used to deliver malicious software onto computers across the Internet. To address this threat, we present a browser independent operating system kernel extension designed to eliminate driveby malware installations. The BLADE (Block All Drive-by download Exploits) system asserts that all executable files delivered through browser downloads must result from explicit user consent and transparently redirects every unconsented browser download into a nonexecutable secure zone of disk. BLADE thwarts the ability of browser-based exploits to surreptitiously download and execute malicious content by remapping to the file system only those browser downloads to which a programmatically inferred user-consent is correlated, BLADE provides its protection without explicit knowledge of any exploits and is thus resilient against code obfuscation and zero-day threats that directly contribute to the pervasiveness of today's drive-by malware. We present the design of our BLADE prototype implementation for the Microsoft Windows platform, and report results from as extensive empirical evaluation of its effectiveness on popular browsers. Our evaluation includes multiple versions of IE and Firefox, against 1,934 active malicious URLs, representing a broad spectrum of web-based exploits not plaguing the Internet. BLADE successfully blocked all drive-by malware install attempts with zero false positives and a 3% worst-case performance cost."
ACM CCS 2010,On the soundness of authenticate-then-encrypt - formalizing the malleability of symmetric encryption.,"A communication channel from an honest sender A to an honest receiver B can be described as a system with three interfaces labeled A, B, and E (the adversary), respectively, where the security properties of the channel are characterized by the capabilities provided at the E-interface."
ACM CCS 2010,Protecting location privacy against inference attacks.,"GPS-enabled mobile devices are a quickly growing market and users are starting to share their location information with each other through services such as Google Latitude. Location information, however, is very privacy-sensitive since it can be used to infer activities, preferences, relationships, and other personal information, and thus access to it must be carefully protected. We provide a formal definition of location privacy that incorporates an adversary's ability to predict location and discuss possible implementation of access control mechanisms that satisfy this definition. To support our reasoning, we analyze a preliminary data set to evaluate the accuracy of location prediction."
ACM CCS 2010,Abstraction by set-membership - verifying security protocols and web services with databases.,"The abstraction and over-approximation of protocols and web services by a set of Horn clauses is a very successful method in practice. It has however limitations for protocols and web services that are based on databases of keys, contracts, or even access rights, where revocation is possible, so that the set of true facts does not monotonically grow with state transitions. We extend the scope of these over-approximation methods by defining a new way of abstraction that can handle such databases, and we formally prove that the abstraction is sound. We realize a translator from a convenient specification language to standard Horn clauses and use the verifier ProVerif and the theorem prover SPASS to solve them. We show by a number of examples that this approach is practically feasible for wide variety of verification problems of security protocols and web services"
ACM CCS 2010,Designs to account for trust in social network-based sybil defenses.,"Social network-based Sybil defenses exploit the trust exhibited in social graphs to detect Sybil nodes that disrupt an algorithmic property (i.e., the fast mixing) in these graphs. The performance of these defenses depends on the quality of the algorithmic property and assuming a strong trust model in the underlying graph. While it is natural to think of trust value associated with the social graphs, Sybil defenses have used the social graphs without this consideration. In this paper we study paramagnetic designs to tune the performance of Sybil defenses by accounting for trust in social graphs and modeling the trust as modified random walks. Our designs are motivated by the observed relationship between the algorithmic property required for the defenses to perform well and a hypothesized trust value in the underlying graphs."
ACM CCS 2010,"Secure encounter-based social networks - requirements, challenges, and designs.","In this paper we outline requirements, challenges, and designs for encounter-based mobile social networks, where relationships are based on a temporarily shared location. To illustrate the challenges we examine a recently proposed design, SMILE, against a set of functional and security requirements. We show that SMILE is vulnerable to several attacks such as impersonation, collusion, and privacy breaching, even though it was built with the explicit goal of resisting some of those attacks. With this in mind, we construct a flexible framework for secure mobile social networks, and describe how to use it in order to construct several networks which offer somewhat different security properties. Each of the designs is then examined against the ideal requirements where some are shown to outperform previous work."
ACM CCS 2010,DieHarder - securing the heap.,"Heap-based attacks depend on a combination of memory management error and an exploitable memory allocator. Many allocators include ad hoc countermeasures against particular exploits but their effectiveness against future exploits has been uncertain. This paper presents the first formal treatment of the impact of allocator design on security. It analyzes a range of widely-deployed memory allocators, including those used by Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD, and shows that they remain vulnerable to attack. It them presents DieHarder, a new allocator whose design was guided by this analysis. DieHarder provides the highest degree of security from heap-based attacks of any practical allocator of which we are aware while imposing modest performance overhead. In particular, the Firefox web browser runs as fast with DieHarder as with the Linux allocator."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure online banking on untrusted computers.,"Frauds and attacks for online banking are increasing quickly. The major platform for current online banking, personal computer, has become untrusted especially under malware attacks. In this study, we design a smart card-based solution called secure online banking companion (SOBC) to address this problem. Portability and cost are also highly considered in the design. We have implemented a prototype of the solution on a Java Card simulator, which shows the solution can be implemented easily using current smart card technologies."
ACM CCS 2010,iFriendU - leveraging 3-cliques to enhance infiltration attacks in online social networks.,"Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as Facebook have become ubiquitous in the past few years, counting hundreds of millions of people as members. OSNs allow users to form friendship relationships, join groups, communicate and share information with friends. The tremendous popularity of OSNs has naturally made them an appealing target for privacy compromising attacks. In this abstract we propose a novel attack against tightly knit OSN communities. Such (artificial) communities consist of users that know well each other and that are reluctant to accept other users as friends. Becoming a member of such a community may be only a first milestone for the attacker. Harvesting private information of members of such communities and following up with offline attacks may be the longer term benefit."
ACM CCS 2010,Modeling attacks on physical unclonable functions.,"We show in this paper how several proposed Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) can be broken by numerical modeling attacks. Given a set of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) of a PUF, our attacks construct a computer algorithm which behaves indistinguishably from the original PUF on almost all CRPs. This algorithm can subsequently impersonate the PUF, and can be cloned and distributed arbitrarily. This breaks the security of essentially all applications and protocols that are based on the respective PUF. The PUFs we attacked successfully include standard Arbited PUFs and Ring Oscillator PUFs of arbitrary sizes, and XO Arbiter PUFs, Lightweight Secure PUFs, and Feed-Forward Arbiter PUFs of up to a given size and complexity. Our attacks are based upon various machine learning techniques including Logistic Regression and Evolution Strategies. Our work leads to new design requirements for secure electrical PUFs, and will be useful to PUF designers and attackers alike."
ACM CCS 2010,Worry-free encryption - functional encryption with public keys.,"In this work, we put forward the notion of Worry-Free Encryption. This allows Alice to encrypt confidential information under Bob's public key and send it to him, without having to worry about whether Bob has the authority to actually access this information. This is done by encrypting the message under a hidden access policy that only allows Bob to decrypt if his credentials satisfy the policy. Our notion can be seen as a functional encryption scheme but in a public-key setting. As such, we are able to insist that even if the credential authority is corrupted, it should not be able to compromise the security of any honest user."
ACM CCS 2010,Demonstrating cognitive packet network resilience to worm attacks.,"The need for network stability and reliability has led to the growth of autonomic networks that can provide more stable and more reliable communications via on-line measurement, learning and adaptation. A promising architecture is the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) that rapidly adapts to varying network conditions and user requirements using QoS driven reinforcement learning algorithms that drive the routing control. Contrary to conventional mechanisms, the users rather than the nodes, control the routing by specifying their desired QoS requirements (QoS Goals), such as Minimum Delay, Maximum Bandwidth, Minimum Cost, etc., and the network then routes each user's traffic individually based on their specific needs and on a ""glocal"" view. In CPN the user has the ability to explore the network for its own needs, and evaluate its own impact on the network as a whole and vice-versa, and then take appropriate decisions. CPN routing has been evaluated extensively under normal operating conditions and has proven to be very adaptive to network changes such as congestion. Here we show how CPN can respond and survive to catastrophic node failures caused by the spread of network worms. This survival is based on two complementary approaches that are run concurrently: one the one hand, each user attempts to concurrently and adaptively avoid paths which are infected, and secondly patching algorithms are continuously run to repair the network. Experiments show that this approach assures the stability of network communications throughout the course of an attack."
ACM CCS 2010,Survivable key compromise in software update systems.,"Today's software update systems have little or no defense against key compromise. As a result, key compromises have put millions of software update clients at risk. Here we identify three classes of information whose authenticity and integrity are critical for secure software updates. Analyzing existing software update systems with our framework, we find their ability to communicate this information securely in the event of a key compromise to be weak or nonexistent. We also find that the security problems in current software update systems are compounded by inadequate trust revocation mechanisms. We identify core security principles that allow software update systems to survive key compromise. Using these ideas, we design and implement TUF, a software update framework that increases resilience to key compromise."
ACM CCS 2010,Losing control of the internet - using the data plane to attack the control plane.,"In this work, we introduce the Coordinated Cross Plane Session Termination, or CXPST, attack, a distributed denial of service attack that attacks the control plane of the Internet. CXPST extends previous work that demonstrates a vulnerability in routers that allows an adversary to disconnect a pair of routers using only data plane traffic. By carefully choosing BGP sessions to terminate, CXPST generates a surge of BGP updates that are seen by nearly all core routers on the Internet. This surge of updates surpasses the computational capacity of affected routers, crippling their ability to make routing decisions"
ACM CCS 2010,Size-based scheduling - a recipe for DDOS?,"Internet traffic measurements have shown that the majority of the Internet's flows are short, while a small percentage of the largest flows are responsible for most of the bytes. To exploit this property for performance improvement in routers and Web servers, several studies have proposed size-based schedulings to offer preferential treatment to the shortest flows. In this work, we present analytical and simulation results which confirm that size-based scheduling will ease the task of launching DDOS attacks on the Internet."
ACM CCS 2010,Robusta - taming the native beast of the JVM.,"Java applications often need to incorporate native-code components for efficiency and for reusing legacy code. However, it is well known that the use of native code defeats Java's security model. We describe the design and implementation of Robusta, a complete framework that provides safety and security to native code in Java applications. Starting from software-based fault isolation (SFI), Robusta isolates native code into a sandbox where dynamic linking/loading of libraries in supported and unsafe system modification and confidentiality violations are prevented. It also mediates native system calls according to a security policy by connecting to Java's security manager. Our prototype implementation of Robusta is based onNative Client and OpenJDK. Experiments in this prototype demonstrate Robusta is effective and efficient, with modest runtime overhead on a set of JNI benchmark programs. Robusta can be used to sandbox native libraries used in Java's system classes to prevent attackers from exploiting bugs in the libraries. It can also enable trustworthy execution of mobile Java programs with native libraries. The design of Robusta should also be applicable when other type-safe languages (e.g., C#, Python) want to ensure safe interoperation with native libraries"
ACM CCS 2010,Developing security protocols by refinement.,"We propose a development method for security protocols based on stepwise refinement. Our refinement strategy guides the transformation of abstract security goals into protocols that are secure when operating over an insecure channel controlled by a Dolev-Yao-style intruder. The refinement steps successively introduce local states, an intruder, communication channels with security properties, and cryptographic operations realizing these channels. The abstractions used provide insights on how the protocols work and foster the development of families of protocols sharing a common structure and properties. In contrast to post-hoc verification methods, protocols are developed together with their correctness proofs. We have implemented our method in Isabelle/HOL and used it to develop different entity authentication and key transport protocols."
ACM CCS 2010,In God we trust all others we monitor.,"Modern x86 platforms offer stealth capabilities, that are exploited by rootkits to hide malicious code as shown by the rootkit evolution. Recently, security researchers discovered a very powerful execution environment for rootkits that is isolated from the actual x86 host platform. According to the capabilities of the isolated environment the researches called it ""ring -3"". Security mechanisms, such as antivirus software, cannot reveal ""ring -3"" rootkits, since they are executed in the operating system which makes them unable to access ""ring -3""."
ACM CCS 2010,User-friendly matching protocol for online social networks.,"In this paper, we outline a privacy-preserving matching protocol for OSN (online social network) users to find their potential friends. With the proposed protocol, a logged-in user can match her profile with that of an off-line stranger, while both profiles are maximally protected. Our solution successfully eliminates the requirement of ""out-of-band"" communication channels, which is one of the biggest obstacles facing cryptographic solutions for OSNs."
ACM CCS 2010,An improved algorithm for tor circuit scheduling.,"Tor is a popular anonymity-preserving network, consisting of routers run by volunteers all around the world. It protects Internet users' privacy by relaying their network traffic through a series of routers, thus concealing the linkage between the sender and the recipient. Despite the advantage of Tor's anonymizing capabilities, it also brings extra latency, which discourages more users from joining the network."
ACM CCS 2010,Hierarchical attribute-based encryption for fine-grained access control in cloud storage services.,"Cloud computing, as an emerging computing paradigm, enables users to remotely store their data into a cloud so as to enjoy scalable services on-demand. Especially for small and medium-sized enterprises with limited budgets, they can achieve cost savings and productivity enhancements by using cloud-based services to manage projects, to make collaborations, and the like. However, allowing cloud service providers (CSPs), which are not in the same trusted domains as enterprise users, to take care of confidential data, may raise potential security and privacy issues. To keep the sensitive user data confidential against untrusted CSPs, a natural way is to apply cryptographic approaches, by disclosing decryption keys only to authorized users. However, when enterprise users outsource confidential data for sharing on cloud servers, the adopted encryption system should not only support fine-grained access control, but also provide high performance, full delegation, and scalability, so as to best serve the needs of accessing data anytime and anywhere, delegating within enterprises, and achieving a dynamic set of users. In this paper, we propose a scheme to help enterprises to efficiently share confidential data on cloud servers. We achieve this goal by first combining the hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) system and the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) system, and then making a performance-expressivity tradeoff, finally applying proxy re-encryption and lazy re-encryption to our scheme."
ACM CCS 2010,In search of an anonymous and secure lookup - attacks on structured peer-to-peer anonymous communication systems.,"The ability to locate random relays is a key challenge for peer-to-peer (P2P) anonymous communication systems. Earlier attempts like Salsa and AP3 used distributes hash table lookups to locate relays, but the lack of anonymity in their lookup mechanisms enables an adversary to infer the path structure and compromise used anonymity. NISAN and Torsk are state-of-the-art systems for P2P anonymous communication. Their designs include mechanisms that are specifically tailored to mitigate information leak attacks. NISAN proposes to add anonymity into the lookup mechanism itself, while Torsk proposes the use of secret buddy nodes to anonymize the lookup initiator. In this paper, we attack the key mechanisms that hide the relationship between a lookup initiator and its selected relays in NISAN and Torsk. We present passive attacks on the NISAN lookup and show that it is not as anonymous as previously thought. We analyze three circuit construction mechanisms for anonymous communication using the NISAN lookup, and show that the information leaks in the NISAN lookup lead to a significant reduction in user anonymity. We also propose active attacks on Torsk that defeat its secret buddy mechanism and consequently compromise user anonymity. Our results are backed up by probabilistic modeling and extensive simulations. Our study motivates the search for a DHT lookup mechanism that is both secure and anonymous."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure dynamic code generation against spraying.,"DCG (Dynamic Code Generation) technologies have found widely applications in the Web 2.0 era, Dion Blazakis recently presented a Flash JIT-Spraying attack against Adobe Flash Player that easily circumvented DEP and ASLR protection mechanisms built in modern operating systems. We have generalized and extended JIT Spraying into DCG Spraying. Based our analyses on this abstract model of DCG Spraying, we have found that all mainstream DCG implementations (Java/ JavaScript/ Flash/ .Net/ SilverLight) are vulnerable against DCG Spraying attack, and none of the existing ad hoc defenses such as compilation optimization, random NOP padding and constant splitting provides effective protection. Furthermore, we propose a new protection method, INSeRT, which combines randomization of intrinsic elements of machine instructions and randomly planted special trapping snippets. INSeRT practically renders the ""sprayed code"" ineffective, while alerts the host program of ongoing attacking attempts. We implemented a prototype of INSeRT on the V8 JavaScript engine, and the performance overhead is less than 5%, which should be acceptable in practical application."
ACM CCS 2010,Testing metrics for password creation policies by attacking large sets of revealed passwords.,"In this paper we attempt to determine the effectiveness of using entropy, as defined in NIST SP800-63, as a measurement of the security provided by various password creation policies. This is accomplished by modeling the success rate of current password cracking techniques against real user passwords. These data sets were collected from several different websites, the largest one containing over 32 million passwords. This focus on actual attack methodologies and real user passwords quite possibly makes this one of the largest studies on password security to date. In addition we examine what these results mean for standard password creation policies, such as minimum password length, and character set requirements."
ACM CCS 2010,Security analysis of India&apos;s electronic voting machines.,"Elections in India are conducted almost exclusively using electronic voting machines developed over the past two decades by a pair of government-owned companies. These devices, known in India as EVMs, have been praised for their simple design, ease of use, and reliability, but recently they have also been criticized following widespread reports of election irregularities. Despite this criticism, many details of the machines' design have never been publicly disclosed, and they have not been subjected to a rigorous, independent security evaluation. In this paper, we present a security analysis of a real Indian EVM obtained from an anonymous source. We describe the machine's design and operation in detail, and we evaluate its security in light of relevant election procedures. We conclude that in spite of the machines' simplicity and minimal software trusted computing base, they are vulnerable to serious attacks that can alter election results and violate the secrecy of the ballot. We demonstrate two attacks, implemented using custom hardware, which could be carried out by dishonest election insiders or other criminals with only brief physical access to the machines. This case study carries important lessons for Indian elections and for electronic voting security more generally."
ACM CCS 2010,Mimimorphism - a new approach to binary code obfuscation.,"Binary obfuscation plays an essential role in evading malware static analysis and detection. The widely used code obfuscation techniques, such as polymorphism and metamorphism, focus on evading syntax based detection. However, statistic test and semantic analysis techniques have been developed to thwart their evasion attempts. More recent binary obfuscation techniques are divided in their purposes of attacking either statistical or semantic approach, but not both. In this paper, we introduce mimimorphism, a novel binary obfuscation technique with the potential of evading both statistical and semantic detections. Mimimorphic malware uses instruction-syntax-aware high-order mimic functions to transform its binary into mimicry executables that exhibit high similarity to benign programs in terms of statistical properties and semantic characteristics. We implement a prototype of the mimimorphic engine on the Intel x86 platform, and evaluate its capability of evading statistical anomaly detection and semantic analysis detection techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that the mimicry executables are indistinguishable from benign programs in terms of byte frequency distribution and entropy, as well as control flow fingerprint."
ACM CCS 2010,Ad hoc broadcast encryption.,"Numerous applications in ad hoc networks, peer-to-peer networks, and on-the-fly data sharing call for confidential broadcast without relying on a dealer. To cater for such applications, we propose a new primitive referred to as ad hoc broadcast encryption (AHBE), in which each user possesses a public key and, upon seeing the public keys of the users, a sender can securely broadcast to any subset of them, so that only the intended users can decrypt. We implement a concrete AHBE scheme proven secure under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE) assumption. The resulting scheme has sub-linear complexity, comparable to up-to-date broadcast systems which have also sub-linear complexity but require a fully trusted dealer."
ACM CCS 2010,A control point for reducing root abuse of file-system privileges.,"We address the problem of restricting root's ability to change arbitrary files on disk, in order to prevent abuse on most current desktop operating systems. The approach first involves recognizing and separating out the ability to configure a system from the ability to use the system to perform tasks. The permission to modify configuration of the system is then further subdivided in order to restrict applications from modifying the file-system objects of other applications. We explore the division of root's current ability to change arbitrary files on disk and discuss a prototype that proves out the viability of the approach for designated system-wide file-system objects. Our architecture exposes a control point available for use to enforce policies that prevent one application from modifying another's file-system objects. In addition, we review in detail the permissions given to current installers, and alternative approaches for secure software installation."
ACM CCS 2010,Dynamic window based multihop authentication for WSN.,"Per-hop authentication is the most effective way to prevent DOS attacks during multihop data delivery. Although the study results show that Public Key Cryptography (PKC) is feasible on sensor nodes with limited resources, it is still very expensive to perform per-hop authentication using public key digital signature. To solve the problem that the resources of WSN is exhausted quickly by PKC, Dynamic Window Based Multihop Authentication(DWMA) for WSN is proposed in this paper. Dynamic window makes it possible to pay only a small number of authentication based on digital signature for confining DoS attacks effectively in a small scope and locating suspicious nodes quickly. Experimental results show that DWMA could save more resources than per-hop authentication for WSN, defend DoS attacks effectively and locate malicious nodes. It's an effective protocol for ensuring the resistance of DoS in routing."
ACM CCS 2010,Spectrum based fraud detection in social networks.,"Social networks are vulnerable to various attacks such as spam emails, viral marketing and the such. In this paper we develop a spectrum based detection framework to discover the perpetrators of these attacks. In particular, we focus on Random Link Attacks (RLAs) in which the malicious user creates multiple false identities and interactions among those identities to later proceed to attack the regular members of the network. We show that RLA attackers can be filtered by using their spectral coordinate characteristics, which are hard to hide even after the efforts by the attackers of resembling as much as possible the rest of the network. Experimental results show that our technique is very effective in detecting those attackers and outperforms techniques previously published."
ACM CCS 2010,Practical leakage-resilient pseudorandom generators.,"Cryptographic systems and protocols are the core of many Internet security procedures (such as SSL, SSH, IPSEC, DNSSEC, secure mail, etc.). At the heart of all cryptographic functions is a good source of randomness, and for efficiency, the primitive of pseudorandom generator (PRG). PRG can also be used in the design of stream ciphers, for secure communications. The Internet is nowadays composed of many types of devices with very different hardware and software characteristics. Hence, one of the concerns in such open environments is the information ""leakage"" and its exploitation via the so-called ""side channel attacks""."
ACM CCS 2010,A portable TPM based on USB key.,"Trusted computing technology aims to enhance the security of platform by the TPM. But there are some drawbacks of TCG's Trusted Computing architecture for user-based applications. This paper presents a new concept of portable TPM (PTM) based on USB Key to solve those problems. At first, we use PTM to establish a trusted path between the verifier and the user in remote attestation so as to propagate the trust chain to the end user. Secondly, we design the trust model and platform management mechanism of PTM. In this model the single point failure of TPM and frequent sensitive data migrations between different platforms are avoided based on PTM. At last, we implement the PTM on the USB Key with Java Card Runtime Environment. The test results show that the PTM scheme is feasible for user-based application."
ACM CCS 2010,Sidebuster - automated detection and quantification of side-channel leaks in web application development.,"A web application is a ""two-part"" program, with its components deployed both in the browser and in the web server. The communication between these two components inevitably leaks out the program's internal states to those eavesdropping on its web traffic, simply through the side channel features of the communication such as packet length and timing, even if the traffic is entirely encrypted. Our recent study shows that such side-channel leaks are both fundamental and realistic: a set of popular web applications are found to disclose highly sensitive user data such as one's family incomes, health profiles, investment secrets and more through their side channels. Our study also shows that an significant improvement of the current web-application development practice is necessary to mitigate this threat. To answer this urgent call, we present in this paper a suite of new techniques for automatic detection and quantification of side-channel leaks in web applications. Our approach, called Sidebuster, can automatically analyze an application's source code to detect its side channels and then perform a rerun test to assess the amount of information disclosed through such channels (quantified as the entropy loss). Sidebuster has been designed to work on event-driven applications and can effectively handle the AJAX GUI widgets used in most web applications. In our research, we implemented a prototype of our technique for analyzing GWT applications and evaluated it using complicated web applications. Our study shows that Sidebuster can effectively identify the side-channel leaks in these applications and assess their severity, with a small overhead."
ACM CCS 2010,The security of modern password expiration - an algorithmic framework and empirical analysis.,"This paper presents the first large-scale study of the success of password expiration in meeting its intended purpose, namely revoking access to an account by an attacker who has captured the account's password. Using a dataset of over 7700 accounts, we assess the extent to which passwords that users choose to replace expired ones pose an obstacle to the attacker's continued access. We develop a framework by which an attacker can search for a user's new password from an old one, and design an efficient algorithm to build an approximately optimal search strategy. We then use this strategy to measure the difficulty of breaking newly chosen passwords from old ones. We believe our study calls into question the merit of continuing the practice of password expiration."
ACM CCS 2010,On efficient ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption and broadcast encryption - extended abstract.,"Existing CP-ABE schemes incur very large ciphertext size, which increases linearly with respect to the number of attributes in the access policy. Large ciphertext prevents CP-ABE from being adopted in the communication constrained environments. In this paper, we proposed a new construction of CP-ABE, named Constant-size CP-ABE (denoted as CCP-ABE) that significantly reduces the ciphertext to a constant size for an AND gate access policy with any given number of attributes. Each ciphertext in CCP-ABE requires only elements on a bilinear group."
ACM CCS 2010,Efficient provable data possession for hybrid clouds.,"Provable data possession is a technique for ensuring the integrity of data in outsourcing storage service. In this paper, we propose a cooperative provable data possession scheme in hybrid clouds to support scalability of service and data migration, in which we consider the existence of multiple cloud service providers to cooperatively store and maintain the clients' data. Our experiments show that the verification of our scheme requires a small, constant amount of overhead, which minimizes communication complexity."
ACM CCS 2010,Attacks and design of image recognition CAPTCHAs.,"We systematically study the design of image recognition CAPTCHAs (IRCs) in this paper. We first review and examine all existing IRCs schemes and evaluate each scheme against the practical requirements in CAPTCHA applications, particularly in large-scale real-life applications such as Gmail and Hotmail. Then we present a security analysis of the representative schemes we have identified. For the schemes that remain unbroken, we present our novel attacks. For the schemes for which known attacks are available, we propose a theoretical explanation why those schemes have failed. Next, we provide a simple but novel framework for guiding the design of robust IRCs. Then we propose an innovative IRC called Cortcha that is scalable to meet the requirements of large-scale applications. It relies on recognizing objects by exploiting the surrounding context, a task that humans can perform well but computers cannot. An infinite number of types of objects can be used to generate challenges, which can effectively disable the learning process in machine learning attacks. Cortcha does not require the images in its image database to be labeled. Image collection and CAPTCHA generation can be fully automated. Our usability studies indicate that, compared with Google's text CAPTCHA, Cortcha allows a slightly higher human accuracy rate but on average takes more time to solve a challenge."
ACM CCS 2010,A cloud based SIM DRM scheme for the mobile internet.,"With the rapid growth of the mobile industry, a considerable amount of mobile applications and services are available. Meanwhile, pirates and illegal distributions of digital contents have become serious issues. Digital Rights Management (DRM) aims at protecting digital contents from being abused through regulating the usage of digital contents. In this paper, a cloud based SIM DRM scheme, called CS-DRM, is proposed for the mobile Internet. Also, a prototype of our DRM scheme is implemented to demonstrate the correctness, effectiveness and efficiency of CS-DRM.",

ACM CCS 2010,"Synchronized aggregate signatures - new definitions, constructions and applications.","An aggregate signature scheme is a digital signature scheme where anyone given n signatures on n messages from n users can aggregate all these signatures into a single short signature. Unfortunately, no ""fully non-interactive"" aggregate signature schemes are known outside of the random oracle heuristic; that is, signers must pass messages between themselves, sequentially or otherwise, to generate the signature. Interaction is too costly for some interesting applications."
ACM CCS 2010,Predictive black-box mitigation of timing channels.,"We investigate techniques for general black-box mitigation of timing channels. The source of events is wrapped by a timing mitigator that delays output events so that they contain only a bounded amount of information. We introduce a general class of timing mitigators that can achieve any given bound on timing channel leakage, with a tradeoff in system performance. We show these mitigators compose well with other mechanisms for information flow control, and demonstrate they are effective against some known timing attacks."
ACM CCS 2010,HyperSentry - enabling stealthy in-context measurement of hypervisor integrity.,"This paper presents HyperSentry, a novel framework to enable integrity measurement of a running hypervisor (or any other highest privileged software layer on a system). Unlike existing solutions for protecting privileged software, HyperSentry does not introduce a higher privileged software layer below the integrity measurement target, which could start another race with malicious attackers in obtaining the highest privilege in the system. Instead, HyperSentry introduces a software component that is properly isolated from the hypervisor to enable stealthy and in-context measurement of the runtime integrity of the hypervisor. While stealthiness is necessary to ensure that a compromised hypervisor does not have a chance to hide the attack traces upon detecting an up-coming measurement, in-context measurement is necessary to retrieve all the needed inputs for a successful integrity measurement."
ACM CCS 2010,Computationally sound verification of source code.,"Increasing attention has recently been given to the formal verification of the source code of cryptographic protocols. The standard approach is to use symbolic abstractions of cryptography that make the analysis amenable to automation. This leaves the possibility of attacks that exploit the mathematical properties of the cryptographic algorithms themselves. In this paper, we show how to conduct the protocol analysis on the source code level (F# in our case) in a computationally sound way, i.e., taking into account cryptographic security definitions."
ACM CCS 2010,PinDr0p - using single-ended audio features to determine call provenance.,"The recent diversification of telephony infrastructure allows users to communicate through landlines, mobile phones and VoIP phones. However, call metadata such as Caller-ID is either not transferred or transferred without verification across these networks, allowing attackers to maliciously alter it. In this paper, we develop PinDr0p, a mechanism to assist users in determining call provenance - the source and the path taken by a call. Our techniques detect and measure single-ended audio features to identify all of the applied voice codecs, calculate packet loss and noise profiles, while remaining agnostic to characteristics of the speaker's voice (as this may legitimately change when interacting with a large organization). In the absence of verifiable call metadata, these features in combination with machine learning allow us to determine the traversal of a call through as many as three different providers (e.g., cellular, then VoIP, then PSTN and all combinations and subsets thereof) with 91.6% accuracy. Moreover, we show that once we identify and characterize the networks traversed, we can create detailed fingerprints for a call source. Using these fingerprints we show that we are able to distinguish between calls made using specific PSTN, cellular, Vonage, Skype and other hard and soft phones from locations across the world with over 90% accuracy. In so doing, we provide a first step in accurately determining the provenance of a call."
ACM CCS 2010,A methodology for empirical analysis of permission-based security models and its application to android.,"Permission-based security models provide controlled access to various system resources. The expressiveness of the permission set plays an important role in providing the right level of granularity in access control. In this work, we present a methodology for the empirical analysis of permission-based security models which makes novel use of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm of Kohonen (2001). While the proposed methodology may be applicable to a wide range of architectures, we analyze 1,100 Android applications as a case study. Our methodology is of independent interest for visualization of permission-based systems beyond our present Android-specific empirical analysis. We offer some discussion identifying potential points of improvement for the Android permission model attempting to increase expressiveness where needed without increasing the total number of permissions or overall complexity."
ACM CCS 2010,Computational indistinguishability logic.,"Computational Indistinguishability Logic (CIL) is a logic for reasoning about cryptographic primitives in computational models. It captures reasoning patterns that are common in provable security, such as simulations and reductions. CIL is sound for the standard model, but also supports reasoning in the random oracle and other idealized models."
ACM CCS 2010,Enhancing resilience of probabilistic key pre-distribution schemes for WSNs through hash chaining.,"We propose, in this paper, a novel class of probabilistic key pre-distribution schemes highly resilient against node capture. We introduce a new approach to enhance resilience by concealing keys through the use of a simple hash chaining mechanism. We provide analytical analysis which shows that our solution enhances the network resilience against node capture without introducing a new overhead comparatively to similar solutions in the literature."
ACM CCS 2010,NoTamper - automatic blackbox detection of parameter tampering opportunities in web applications.,"Web applications rely heavily on client-side computation to examine and validate form inputs that are supplied by a user (e.g., ""credit card expiration date must be valid""). This is typically done for two reasons: to reduce burden on the server and to avoid latencies in communicating with the server. However, when a server fails to replicate the validation performed on the client, it is potentially vulnerable to attack. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically detecting potential server-side vulnerabilities of this kind in existing (legacy) web applications through blackbox analysis. We discuss the design and implementation of NoTamper, a tool that realizes this approach. NoTamper has been employed to discover several previously unknown vulnerabilities in a number of open-source web applications and live web sites."
ACM CCS 2010,TAPS - automatically preparing safe SQL queries.,We present the first sound program transformation approach for automatically transforming the code of a legacy web application to employ PREPARE statements in place of unsafe SQL queries. Our approach therefore opens the way for eradicating the SQL injection threat vector from legacy web applications. This extended abstract is based on our paper[4] that appeared in the Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC'2010) conference.
ACM CCS 2010,Algebraic pseudorandom functions with improved efficiency from the augmented cascade.,"We construct an algebraic pseudorandom function (PRF) that is more efficient than the classic Naor-Reingold algebraic PRF. Our PRF is the result of adapting the cascade construction, which is the basis of HMAC, to the algebraic settings. To do so we define an augmented cascade and prove it secure when the underlying PRF satisfies a property called parallel security. We then use the augmented cascade to build new algebraic PRFs. The algebraic structure of our PRF leads to an efficient large-domain Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and a large-domain simulatable VRF."
ACM CCS 2010,Attacking and fixing PKCS#11 security tokens.,"We show how to extract sensitive cryptographic keys from a variety of commercially available tamper resistant cryptographic security tokens, exploiting vulnerabilities in their RSA PKCS#11 based APIs. The attacks are performed by Tookan, an automated tool we have developed, which reverse-engineers the particular token in use to deduce its functionality, constructs a model of its API for a model checker, and then executes any attack trace found by the model checker directly on the token. We describe the operation of Tookan and give results of testing the tool on 17 commercially available tokens: 9 were vulnerable to attack, while the other 8 had severely restricted functionality. One of the attacks found by the model checker has not previously appeared in the literature. We show how Tookan may be used to verify patches to insecure devices, and give a secure configuration that we have implemented in a patch to a software token simulator. This is the first such configuration to appear in the literature that does not require any new cryptographic mechanisms to be added to the standard. We comment on lessons for future key management APIs."
ACM CCS 2010,Protecting portable storage with host validation.,"Portable storage devices, such as key-chain USB devices, are ubiquitous and used everywhere; users repeatedly use the same storage device in open computer laboratories, Internet cafes, and on office and home computers. Consequently, they are the target of malware that exploit the data present or use them as a means to propagate malicious software., e.g., Conficker and Agent.bz. We present the Kells mobile storage system, which limits untrusted or unknown systems from accessing sensitive data by continuously validating the accessing host's integrity state. We explore the design and operation of Kells, and implement a proof-of-concept USB 2.0 storage device of experimental hardware. Our experiments indicate nominal overheads associated with host validation, with a worst-case throughput overhead of 1.22% for reads and 2.78% for writes."
ACM CCS 2010,Input generation via decomposition and re-stitching - finding bugs in Malware.,"Attackers often take advantage of vulnerabilities in benign software, and the authors of benign software must search their code for bugs in hopes of finding vulnerabilities before they are exploited. But there has been little research on the converse question of whether defenders can turn the tables by finding vulnerabilities in malware. We provide a first affirmative answer to that question. We introduce a new technique, stitched dynamic symbolic execution, that makes it possible to use exploration techniques based on symbolic execution in the presence of functionalities that are common in malware and otherwise hard to analyze, such as decryption and checksums. The technique is based on decomposing the constraints induced by a program, solving only a subset, and then re-stitching the constraint solution into a complete input. We implement the approach in a system for x86 binaries, and apply it to 4 prevalent families of bots and other malware. We find 6 bugs that could be exploited by a network attacker to terminate or subvert the malware. These bugs have persisted across malware revisions for months, and even years. We discuss the possible applications and ethical considerations of this new capability"
ACM CCS 2010,Virtual browser - a web-level sandbox to secure third-party JavaScript without sacrificing functionality.,"Third-party JavaScript offers much more diversity to Web and its applications but also introduces new threats. Those scripts cannot be completely trusted and executed with the privileges given to host web sites. Due to incomplete virtualization and lack of tracking all the data flows, all the existing works in this area can secure only a subset of third-party JavaScript. At the same time, because of the existence of not so well documented browser quirks, attacks may be encoded in non standard HTML/JavaScript so that they can bypass existing approaches as these approaches will parse third-party JavaScript twice, at both server and client side."
ACM CCS 2010,Retaining sandbox containment despite bugs in privileged memory-safe code.,"Flaws in the standard libraries of secure sandboxes represent a major security threat to billions of devices worldwide. The standard libraries are hard to secure because they frequently need to perform low-level operations that are forbidden in untrusted application code. Existing designs have a single, large trusted computing base that contains security checks at the boundaries between trusted and untrusted code. Unfortunately, flaws in the standard library often allow an attacker to escape the security protections of the sandbox."
ACM CCS 2010,Platform-independent programs.,"Given a single program (i.e., bit string), one may assume that the program's behaviors can be determined by first identifying the native runtime architecture and then executing the program on that architecture. In this paper, we challenge the notion that programs run on a single architecture by developing techniques that automatically create a single program string that a) runs on different architectures, and b) potentially has different behaviors depending upon which architecture it runs on. At a high level, a primary security implication is that any program analysis done on a program must only be considered valid for the assumed architecture. Our techniques also introduce a new type of steganography that hides execution behaviors. In order to demonstrate our techniques, we implement a system for generating platform-independent programs for x86, ARM, and MIPS. We use our system to generate real platform-independent programs."
ACM CCS 2010,CardSpace in the cloud.,"This paper describes a web based federated identity management system which is based on the user centric approach of the Information Card model, and has been enhanced to remove many of the problems inherent in Microsoft's original design. Furthermore the new design is adapted to interwork with existing SAML 2 federations. Our model supports not only improved user mobility and the aggregation of claims from multiple identity providers (IdPs), but also user authentication via just one of the IdPs without placing any constraints on the authentication mechanism that is used. This is achieved by introducing a new component, the Linking Identity Selector, which allows the user to select multiple cards at service provision time. Users can then use the combined set of credentials to access a wider range of web based resources. We describe our first example application which allows the user to present a credit card, a self asserted card, a hotel loyalty card and a frequent flyer card in order to make an online hotel booking, using voice biometrics for authentication."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure latency estimation with treeple.,"A network latency estimation scheme associates a ""position"" to every peer in a distributed network such that the latency between any two nodes can be accurately estimated from their positions. Applications for these schemes include efficient overlay construction, compact routing, anonymous route selection, and efficient byzantine agreement. We present a new latency estimation scheme, Treeple. Our scheme is different from existing ones in several aspects: Treeple is provably secure, rather than being able to resist known attacks; positions in Treeple are not Euclidean coordinates and reflect the underlying network topology; finally, positions in Treeple are accurate, stable, and can be assigned to peers not participating in the system."
ACM CCS 2010,Symbolic security analysis of ruby-on-rails web applications.,"Many of today's web applications are built on frameworks that include sophisticated defenses against malicious adversaries. However, mistakes in the way developers deploy those defenses could leave applications open to attack. To address this issue, we introduce Rubyx, a symbolic executor that we use to analyze Ruby-on-Rails web applications for security vulnerabilities. Rubyx specifications can easily be adapted to variety of properties, since they are built from general assertions, assumptions, and object invariants. We show how to write Ruby specifications to detect susceptibility to cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery, insufficient authentication, leaks of secret information, insufficient access control, as well as application-specific security properties. We used Rubyx to check seven web applications from various sources against out specifications. We found many vulnerabilities, and each application was subject to at least one critical attack. Encouragingly, we also found that it was relatively easy to fix most vulnerabilities, and that Rubyx showed the absence of attacks after our fixes. Our results suggest that Rubyx is a promising new way to discover security vulnerabilities in Ruby-on-Rails web applications."
ACM CCS 2010,Return-oriented programming without returns.,"We show that on both the x86 and ARM architectures it is possible to mount return-oriented programming attacks without using return instructions. Our attacks instead make use of certain instruction sequences that behave like a return, which occur with sufficient frequency in large libraries on (x86) Linux and (ARM) Android to allow creation of Turing-complete gadget sets."
ACM CCS 2010,Inference and analysis of formal models of botnet command and control protocols.,"We propose a novel approach to infer protocol state machines in the realistic high-latency network setting, and apply it to the analysis of botnet Command and Control (C &C) protocols. Our proposed techniques enable an order of magnitude reduction in the number of queries and time needed to learn a botnet C &C protocol compared to classic algorithms (from days to hours for inferring the MegaD C &C protocol). We also show that the computed protocol state machines enable formal analysis for botnet defense, including finding the weakest links in a protocol, uncovering protocol design flaws, inferring the existence of unobservable communication back-channels among botnet servers, and finding deviations of protocol implementations which can be used for fingerprinting. We validate our technique by inferring the protocol state-machine from Postfix's SMTP implementation and comparing the inferred state-machine to the SMTP standard. Further, our experimental results offer new insights into MegaD's C &C, showing our technique can be used as a powerful tool for defense against botnets."
ACM CCS 2010,Practical leakage-resilient identity-based encryption from simple assumptions.,"We design the first Leakage-Resilient Identity-Based Encryption (LR-IBE) systems from static assumptions in the standard model. We derive these schemes by applying a hash proof technique from Alwen et.al. (Eurocrypt '10) to variants of the existing IBE schemes of Boneh-Boyen, Waters, and Lewko-Waters. As a result, we achieve leakage-resilience under the respective static assumptions of the original systems in the standard model, while also preserving the efficiency of the original schemes. Moreover, our results extend to the Bounded Retrieval Model (BRM), yielding the first regular and identity-based BRM encryption schemes from static assumptions in the standard model."
ACM CCS 2010,Dissecting one click frauds.,"""One Click Fraud"" is an online confidence scam that has been plaguing an increasing number of Japanese Internet users, in spite of new laws and the mobilization of police task forces. In this scam, the victim clicks on a link presented to them, only to be informed that they just entered a binding contract and are required to pay a registration fee for a service. Even though no money is legally owed, a large number of users prefer to pay up, because of potential embarrassment due to the type of service ""requested"" (e.g., pornographic goods)."
ACM CCS 2010,Dissent - accountable anonymous group messaging.,"Users often wish to participate in online groups anonymously, but misbehaving users may abuse this anonymity to disrupt the group's communication. Existing messaging protocols such as DC-nets leave groups vulnerable to denial-of-service and Sybil attacks, Mix-nets are difficult to protect against traffic analysis, and accountable voting protocols are unsuited to general anonymous messaging."
ACM CCS 2010,TEE - a virtual DRTM based execution environment for secure cloud-end computing.,"Cloud computing is believed to be the next major paradigm of computing because it will substantially reduce the cost of IT systems. Ensuring security in the cloud-end is necessary because customers' data are stored and processed there. Previous studies have mainly focused on secure cloud-end storage, whereas secure cloud-end computing is much less investigated. The current practice is solely based on Virtual Machines (VM), and cannot offer adequate security because the guest Operating Systems (OS) often can be easily breached (e.g., by exploiting their vulnerabilities). This motivates the need of solutions for more secure cloud-end computing. This poster presents the design, implementation and analysis of a candidate solution, called Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which takes advantage of both virtualization and trusted computing technologies simultaneously. The novelty behind TEE is the virtualization of the Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM)."
ACM CCS 2010,On the (in)security of IPsec in MAC-then-encrypt configurations.,"IPsec allows a huge amount of flexibility in the ways in which its component cryptographic mechanisms can be combined to build a secure communications service. This may be good for supporting different security requirements but is potentially bad for security. We demonstrate the reality of this by describing efficient, plaintext-recovering attacks against all configurations of IPsec in which integrity protection is applied {\em prior} to encryption -- so-called MAC-then-encrypt configurations. We report on the implementation of our attacks against a specific IPsec implementation, and reflect on the implications of our attacks for real-world IPsec deployments as well as for theoretical cryptography."
ACM CCS 2010,Laptop theft - a case study on the effectiveness of security mechanisms in open organizations.,"Organizations rely on physical, technical and procedural mechanisms to protect their IT systems. Of all IT systems, laptops are the probably the most troublesome to protect, since they are easy to remove and conceal. When the thief has physical possession of the laptop, it is difficult to protect the data inside. Organizations open to the public, such as hospitals and universities, are easy targets for laptop thieves, since every day many people wander in the premises."
ACM CCS 2010,Information security for sensors by overwhelming random sequences and permutations.,"We propose efficient schemes for information-theoretically secure key exchange in the Bounded Storage Model (BSM), where the adversary is assumed to have limited storage. Our schemes generate a secret One Time Pad (OTP) shared by the sender and the receiver,from a large number of public random bits produced by the sender or by an external source. Our schemes initially generate a small number of shared secret bits, using known techniques. We introduce a new method to expand a small number of shared bits to a much longer, shared key."
ACM CCS 2010,On verifying stateful dataflow processing services in large-scale cloud systems.,"Cloud computing needs to provide integrity assurance in order to support security sensitive application services such as critical dataflow processing. In this paper, we present a novel RObust Service Integrity Attestation (ROSIA) framework that can efficiently verify the integrity of stateful dataflow processing services and pinpoint malicious service providers within a large-scale cloud system. ROSIA achieves robustness by supporting stateful dataflow services such as windowed stream operators, and performing integrated consistency check to detect colluding attacks. We have implemented ROSIA on top of the IBM System S dataflow processing system and tested it on the NCSU virtual computing lab. Our experimental results show that our scheme is feasible and efficient for large-scale cloud systems."
ACM CCS 2010,A privacy recommendation wizard for users of social networking sites.,"Privacy is a huge problem for users of social networking sites. While sites like Facebook allow individual users to personalize fine-grained privacy settings, this has proven quite difficult for average users. This demonstration illustrates a machine learning privacy wizard, or recommendation tool, that we have built at the University of Michigan. The wizard is based on the underlying observation that real users conceive their privacy preferences (which friends should see which data items) based on an implicit structure. Thus, after asking the user a limited number of carefully-chosen questions, it is usually possible to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the user's privacy preferences. This model, in turn, can be used to recommend detailed privacy settings for the user. Our demonstration wizard runs as a third-party Facebook application. Conference attendees will be able to ""test-drive"" the wizard by installing it on their own Facebook accounts."
ACM CCS 2010,Assessing trust in uncertain information using Bayesian description logic.,"Decision makers (humans or software agents alike) are faced with the challenge of examining large volumes of information originating from heterogeneous sources with the goal of ascertaining trust in various pieces of information. In this paper we argue (using examples) that traditional trust models are limited in their data model by assuming a pair-wise numeric rating between two entities (e.g., eBay recommendations, Netflix movie rating, etc). We present a novel trust computational model for rich, complex and uncertain information encoded using Bayesian Description Logics. We present security and scalability tradeoffs that arise in the new model, and the results of an evaluation of the first prototype implementation under a variety attack scenarios."
ACM CCS 2010,Detecting and characterizing social spam campaigns.,"Online social networks (OSNs) are exceptionally useful collaboration and communication tools for millions of users and their friends. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, they are also extremely effective tools for executing spam campaigns and spreading malware."
ACM CCS 2010,"Dismantling SecureMemory, CryptoMemory and CryptoRF.","The Atmel chip families SecureMemory, CryptoMemory, and CryptoRF use a proprietary stream cipher to guarantee authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity. This paper describes the cipher in detail and points out several weaknesses. One is the fact that the three components of the cipher operate largely independently; another is that the intermediate output generated by two of those components is strongly correlated with the generated keystream. For SecureMemory, a single eavesdropped trace is enough to recover the secret key with probability 0.57 in 2^{39} cipher ticks. This is a factor of 2^{31.5} faster than a brute force attack. On a 2 GHz laptop, this takes around 10 minutes. With more traces, the secret key can be recovered with virtual certainty without significant additional cost in time. For CryptoMemory and CryptoRF, if one has 2640 traces it is possible to recover the key in 2^{52} cipher ticks, which is 2^{19} times faster than brute force. On a 50 machine cluster of 2 GHz quad-core machines this would take less than 2 days."
ACM CCS 2010,Building efficient fully collusion-resilient traitor tracing and revocation schemes.,"In [8,9] Boneh et al. presented the first fully collusion-resistant traitor tracing and trace & revoke schemes. These schemes are based on composite order bilinear groups and their security depends on the hardness of the subgroup decision assumption."
ACM CCS 2010,Fingerprinting websites using remote traffic analysis.,"Recent work has shown that traffic analysis of data carried on encrypted tunnels can be used to recover important semantic information. As one example, attackers can find out which website, or which page on a website, a user is accessing simply by monitoring the traffic patterns. We show that traffic analysis is a much greater threat to privacy than previously thought, as such attacks can be carried out remotely. In particular, we show that, to perform traffic analysis, adversaries do not need to directly observe the traffic patterns. Instead, they can send probes from a far-off vantage point that exploit a queuing side channel in routers."
ACM CCS 2010,@spam - the underground on 140 characters or less.,"In this work we present a characterization of spam on Twitter. We find that 8% of 25 million URLs posted to the site point to phishing, malware, and scams listed on popular blacklists. We analyze the accounts that send spam and find evidence that it originates from previously legitimate accounts that have been compromised and are now being puppeteered by spammers. Using clickthrough data, we analyze spammers' use of features unique to Twitter and the degree that they affect the success of spam. We find that Twitter is a highly successful platform for coercing users to visit spam pages, with a clickthrough rate of 0.13%, compared to much lower rates previously reported for email spam. We group spam URLs into campaigns and identify trends that uniquely distinguish phishing, malware, and spam, to gain an insight into the underlying techniques used to attract users."
ACM CCS 2010,A new framework for efficient password-based authenticated key exchange.,"Protocols for password-based authenticated key exchange (PAKE) allow two users who share only a short, low-entropy password to agree on a cryptographically strong session key. The challenge in designing such protocols is that they must be immune to off-line dictionary attacks in which an eavesdropping adversary exhaustively enumerates the dictionary of likely passwords in an attempt to match a password to the set of observed transcripts."
ACM CCS 2010,On pairing constrained wireless devices based on secrecy of auxiliary channels - the case of acoustic eavesdropping.,"Secure ""pairing"" of wireless devices based on auxiliary or out-of-band (OOB) - audio, visual or tactile - communication is a well-established research direction. Lack of good quality interfaces on or physical access to certain constrained devices (e.g., headsets, access points, medical implants) makes pairing a challenging problem in practice. Prior work shows that pairing of constrained devices based on authenticated OOB (A-OOB) channels can be prone to human errors that eventually translate into man-in-the-middle attacks. An alternative and more usable solution is to use OOB channel(s) that are authenticated as well as secret (AS-OOB). AS-OOB pairing can be achieved by simply transmitting the key or a short password over the AS-OOB channel, avoiding potential serious human errors."
ACM CCS 2010,Efficient sensor node authentication via 3GPP mobile communication networks.,"Energy efficiency is one of important issues in the resource constrained wireless sensor network. In this paper, we propose the authentication and key agreement protocol that efficiently reduces the overall computational and communication costs in the next generation converged network. The enhanced security procedures are operated through the mobile network in order to maximize the lifetime of the sensor networks and to apply the combined capabilities of both networks."
ACM CCS 2010,DIFC programs by automatic instrumentation.,"Decentralized information flow control (DIFC) operating systems provide applications with mechanisms for enforcing information flow policies for their data. However, significant obstacles keep such operating systems from achieving widespread adoption. One key obstacle is that DIFC operating systems provide only low-level mechanisms for allowing application programmers to enforce their desired policies. It can be difficult for the programmer to ensure that their use of these mechanisms enforces their high-level policies, while at the same time not breaking the underlying functionality of their application. These are issues both for programmers who would develop new applications for a DIFC operating system and for programmers who would port existing applications to a DIFC operating system. Our work significantly eases these tasks. We present as automatic technique that takes as input a program with no DIFC code, and two policies: one that specifies prohibited information flows and one that specifies flows that must be allowed. Our technique then produces a new version of the input program that satisfies the two policies. To evaluate out technique, we implemented it in an automatic tool, called Swim (for Secure What I Mean), and applied it to a set of real-world programs and policies. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that the technique is sufficiently expressive to produce programs for real-world policies, and that it can produce such programs efficiently. It thus represents a significant contribution towards developing systems with strong end-to-end information flow guarantees."
ACM CCS 2010,TASTY - tool for automating secure two-party computations.,"Secure two-party computation allows two untrusting parties to jointly compute an arbitrary function on their respective private inputs while revealing no information beyond the outcome. Existing cryptographic compilers can automatically generate secure computation protocols from high-level specifications, but are often limited in their use and efficiency of generated protocols as they are based on either garbled circuits or (additively) homomorphic encryption only."
ACM CCS 2010,Rendezvous tunnel for anonymous publishing.,"Many anonymous peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems have been proposed in recent years. One problem that remains open is how to protect the anonymity of all participating users, namely, reader, server and publisher. In this work we propose a novel solution for a P2P file sharing system. Our solution provides overall anonymity to all participating users."
ACM CCS 2010,Protecting browsers from cross-origin CSS attacks.,"Cross-origin CSS attacks use style sheet import to steal confidential information from a victim website, hijacking a user's existing authenticated session; existing XSS defenses are ineffective. We show how to conduct these attacks with any browser, even if JavaScript is disabled, and propose a client-side defense with little or no impact on the vast majority of web sites. We have implemented and deployed defenses in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari. Our defense proposal has also been adopted by Opera."
ACM CCS 2010,Exploiting social networking sites for spam.,"In the ongoing arms race between spammers and the multi-million dollar anti-spam industry, the number of unsolicited e-mail messages (better known as ""spam"") and phishing has increased heavily in the last decade. In this paper, we show that our novel friend-in-the-middle attack on social networking sites (SNSs) can be used to harvest social data in an automated fashion. This social data can then be exploited for large-scale attacks such as context-aware spam and social-phishing. We prove the feasibility of our attack exemplarily on Facebook and identify possible consequences based on a mathematical model and simulations. Alarmingly, all major SNSs are vulnerable to our attack as they fail to secure the network layer appropriately."
ACM CCS 2010,Mobile location tracking in metro areas - malnets and others.,"Digital wireless radios broadcast identification numbers that uniquely identify them. As has been previously observed, given the ubiquity with which people carry smartphones with their embedded WiFi radios powered on, comes the ability to track individuals' movements. The ability to use wireless radios for positioning has been previously observed and developed in to useful products. In these systems a user willingly geolocates themselves by providing identifiers to infrastructure hardware. In this paper we consider the converse question: what rates of monitoring by smartphones devices in a given metropolitan area are necessary to achieve different levels of involuntary geolocation. While previous work has looked at countermeasure that attempt to maintain privacy, no work has attempted to quantify the problem and risks. Using appropriate simulations we give the first quantitative support for the number and conditions of tracking devices necessary to track the locations of non-participant individuals in urban environments. We provide evidence that a small, but not insignificant, number of mobile devices can be used to track a majority of users during a significant fraction of their travel with current devices. We conclude that in the immediate future, malnets would require relatively high infection rates to pose a significant threat, but that voluntary networks, with perceived benefit can probably achieve the usage rates necessary to track individual movements of non-subscribed users to a high-degree of accuracy. Our results also suggest ubiquitous deployment of 802.11n in smartphones would make geolocation feasible by malnets"
ACM CCS 2010,An implementation of event and filter confidentiality in pub/sub systems and its application to e-health.,"The publish/subscribe model offers a loosely-coupled communication paradigm where applications interact indirectly and asynchronously. Publisher applications generate events that are forwarded to subscriber applications by a network of brokers. Subscribers register by specifying filters that brokers match against events as part of the routing process. Brokers might be deployed on untrusted servers where malicious entities can get access to events and filters. Supporting confidentiality of events and filters in this setting is still an open challenge. First of all, it is desirable that publishers and subscribers do not share secret keys, such a requirement being against the loose-coupling of the model. Second, brokers need to route events by matching encrypted events against encrypted filters. This should be possible even with very complex filters. Existing solutions do not fully address these issues. This work describes the implementation of a novel schema that supports (i) confidentiality for events and filters; (ii) filters that express very complex constraints on events even if brokers are not able to access any information on both events and filters; (iii) and finally, does not require publishers and subscribers to share keys. We then describe an e-Health application scenario for monitoring patients with chronic diseases and show how our encryption schema can be used to provide confidentiality of the patients' personal and medical data, and control who can receive the patients' data and under which conditions."

ACM CCS 2010,An empirical study of privacy-violating information flows in JavaScript web applications.,"The dynamic nature of JavaScript web applications has given rise to the possibility of privacy violating information flows. We present an empirical study of the prevalence of such flows on a large number of popular websites. We have (1) designed an expressive, fine-grained information flow policy language that allows us to specify and detect different kinds of privacy-violating flows in JavaScript code,(2) implemented a new rewriting-based JavaScript information flow engine within the Chrome browser, and (3) used the enhanced browser to conduct a large-scale empirical study over the Alexa global top 50,000 websites of four privacy-violating flows: cookie stealing, location hijacking, history sniffing, and behavior tracking. Our survey shows that several popular sites, including Alexa global top-100 sites, use privacy-violating flows to exfiltrate information about users' browsing behavior. Our findings show that steps must be taken to mitigate the privacy threat from covert flows in browsers."
ACM CCS 2010,Recruiting new tor relays with BRAIDS.,"Tor, a distributed Internet anonymizing system, relies on volunteers who run dedicated relays. Other than altruism, these volunteers have no incentive to run relays, causing a large disparity between the number of users and available relays. We introduce BRAIDS, a set of practical mechanisms that encourages users to run Tor relays, allowing them to earn credits redeemable for improved performance of both interactive and non-interactive Tor traffic. These performance incentives will allow Tor to support increasing resource demands with almost no loss in anonymity: BRAIDS is robust to well-known attacks. Using a simulation of 20,300 Tor nodes, we show that BRAIDS allows relays to achieve 75% lower latency than non-relays for interactive traffic, and 90% higher bandwidth utilization for non-interactive traffic."
ACM CCS 2010,Designing router scheduling policies - a privacy perspective.,"We examine a queuing side channel which results from a shared resource between two users in the context of packet networks. We consider the scenario where one of them is a legitimate user and the other is an attacker who is trying to learn about the former's activities. We show that the waiting time of an adversary sending a small but frequent probe stream to the shared resource (e.g., a router) is highly correlated with traffic pattern of the user."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure text processing with applications to private DNA matching.,"Motivated by the problem of private DNA matching, we consider the design of efficient protocols for secure text processing. Here, informally, a party P1 holds a text T and a party P2 holds a pattern p and some additional information y, and P2 wants to learn {f(T,j,y)} for all locations j where p is found as a substring in T. (In particular, this generalizes the basic pattern matching problem.) We aim for protocols with full security against a malicious P2 that also preserve privacy against a malicious P1 (i.e., one-sided security). We show how to modify Yao's garbled circuit approach to obtain a protocol where the size of the garbled circuit is linear in the number of occurrences of p in T (rather than linear in $|T|$). Along the way we show a new keyword search protocol that may be of independent interest."
ACM CCS 2010,CRAFT - a new secure congestion control architecture.,"Congestion control algorithms seek to optimally utilize network resources by allocating a certain rate for each user. However, malicious clients can disregard the congestion control algorithms implemented at the clients and induce congestion at bottleneck links. Thus, in an adversarial environment, the network must enforce the congestion control algorithm in order to attain the optimal network utilization offered by the algorithm. Prior work protects only a single link incident on the enforcement routers neglecting damage inflicted upon other downstream links. We present CRAFT, a capability-based scheme to secure all downstream links of a deploying router. Our goal is to enforce a network-wide congestion control algorithm on all flows. As a reference design, we develop techniques to enforce the TCP congestion control. Our design regulates all flows to share bandwidth resources in a TCP-fair manner by emulating the TCP state machine in a CRAFT router. As a result, once a flow passes a single CRAFT router, it is TCP-fair on all downstream links of that router."
ACM CCS 2010,Trail of bytes - efficient support for forensic analysis.,"For the most part, forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we tend to lack detailed information just when we need it the most. Simply put, the current state of computer forensics leaves much to be desired. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromised has been detected."
ACM CCS 2010,Timing attacks on PIN input devices.,"Keypads are commonly used to enter personal identification numbers (PIN) which are intended to authenticate a user based on what they know. A number of those keypads such as ATM inputs and door keypads provide an audio feedback to the user for each button pressed. Such audio feedback are observable from a modest distance. We are looking at quantifying the information leaking from delays between acoustic feedback pulses. Preliminary experiments suggest that by using a Hidden Markov Model, it might be possible to substantially narrow the search space. A subsequent brute force search on the reduced search space could be possible with- out triggering alerts, lockouts or other mechanisms design to thwart plain brute force attempts."
ACM CCS 2010,Accountability - definition and relationship to verifiability.,"Many cryptographic tasks and protocols, such as non-repudiation, contract-signing, voting, auction, identity-based encryption, and certain forms of secure multi-party computation, involve the use of (semi-)trusted parties, such as notaries and authorities. It is crucial that such parties can be held accountable in case they misbehave as this is a strong incentive for such parties to follow the protocol. Unfortunately, there does not exist a general and convincing definition of accountability that would allow to assess the level of accountability a protocol provides."
ACM CCS 2010,AccessMiner - using system-centric models for malware protection.,"Models based on system calls are a popular and common approach to characterize the run-time behavior of programs. For example, system calls are used by intrusion detection systems to detect software exploits. As another example, policies based on system calls are used to sandbox applications or to enforce access control. Given that malware represents a significant security threat for today's computing infrastructure, it is not surprising that system calls were also proposed to distinguish between benign processes and malicious code."
ACM CCS 2010,SecTag - a multi-policy supported secure web tag framework.,"Traditional web application development often encounters tight coupling problem between access control logic and business logic. It is hard to configure and modify access control policies after a system has been deployed. In this demonstration, we present SecTag, a multi-policy supported secure web tag framework, to address this problem. We define a series of general-purpose secure attributes that meet the demand of fine-grained access control in web presentation layer. We also design a set of high interactive secure tags, which encapsulate secure features to provide reusable secure components for web development. A running example of SecTag is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
ACM CCS 2010,Dialog-based payload aggregation for intrusion detection.,"Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) such as Snort or Bro that have to analyze the packet payload for all the received data show severe performance problems if used in high-speed networks. Recent research results improve pattern matchers based on efficient algorithms or using specialized hardware. We approach the problem in a completely different way by considerably reducing the amount of data to be analyzed with only marginal impact on the detection quality. Dialog-based Payload Aggregation (DPA) uses TCP sequence numbers to decide which parts of the payload need to be analyzed by the IDS. Whenever a connection starts, or if the direction of the data transmission between peers changes, we forward the next N bytes of traffic to an attached IDS. All data transferred after the window is discarded. Our analysis using live network traffic and multiple Snort rulesets shows that most of the pattern matches occur at the beginning of connections or directly after direction changes in the data streams. According to our experimental results, our method reduces the data rate to be processed to around 1% in a typical network while retaining more than 98% of all detected events. Assuming a linear relationship between the data rate and processing time of an IDS, this results in a speedup of two magnitudes in the best case."
ACM CCS 2010,BLADE - an attack-agnostic approach for preventing drive-by malware infections.,"Web-based surreptitious malware infections (i.e., drive-by downloads) have become the primary method used to deliver malicious software onto computers across the Internet. To address this threat, we present a browser independent operating system kernel extension designed to eliminate driveby malware installations. The BLADE (Block All Drive-by download Exploits) system asserts that all executable files delivered through browser downloads must result from explicit user consent and transparently redirects every unconsented browser download into a nonexecutable secure zone of disk. BLADE thwarts the ability of browser-based exploits to surreptitiously download and execute malicious content by remapping to the file system only those browser downloads to which a programmatically inferred user-consent is correlated, BLADE provides its protection without explicit knowledge of any exploits and is thus resilient against code obfuscation and zero-day threats that directly contribute to the pervasiveness of today's drive-by malware. We present the design of our BLADE prototype implementation for the Microsoft Windows platform, and report results from as extensive empirical evaluation of its effectiveness on popular browsers. Our evaluation includes multiple versions of IE and Firefox, against 1,934 active malicious URLs, representing a broad spectrum of web-based exploits not plaguing the Internet. BLADE successfully blocked all drive-by malware install attempts with zero false positives and a 3% worst-case performance cost."
ACM CCS 2010,On the soundness of authenticate-then-encrypt - formalizing the malleability of symmetric encryption.,"A communication channel from an honest sender A to an honest receiver B can be described as a system with three interfaces labeled A, B, and E (the adversary), respectively, where the security properties of the channel are characterized by the capabilities provided at the E-interface."
ACM CCS 2010,Protecting location privacy against inference attacks.,"GPS-enabled mobile devices are a quickly growing market and users are starting to share their location information with each other through services such as Google Latitude. Location information, however, is very privacy-sensitive since it can be used to infer activities, preferences, relationships, and other personal information, and thus access to it must be carefully protected. We provide a formal definition of location privacy that incorporates an adversary's ability to predict location and discuss possible implementation of access control mechanisms that satisfy this definition. To support our reasoning, we analyze a preliminary data set to evaluate the accuracy of location prediction."
ACM CCS 2010,Abstraction by set-membership - verifying security protocols and web services with databases.,"The abstraction and over-approximation of protocols and web services by a set of Horn clauses is a very successful method in practice. It has however limitations for protocols and web services that are based on databases of keys, contracts, or even access rights, where revocation is possible, so that the set of true facts does not monotonically grow with state transitions. We extend the scope of these over-approximation methods by defining a new way of abstraction that can handle such databases, and we formally prove that the abstraction is sound. We realize a translator from a convenient specification language to standard Horn clauses and use the verifier ProVerif and the theorem prover SPASS to solve them. We show by a number of examples that this approach is practically feasible for wide variety of verification problems of security protocols and web services"
ACM CCS 2010,Designs to account for trust in social network-based sybil defenses.,"Social network-based Sybil defenses exploit the trust exhibited in social graphs to detect Sybil nodes that disrupt an algorithmic property (i.e., the fast mixing) in these graphs. The performance of these defenses depends on the quality of the algorithmic property and assuming a strong trust model in the underlying graph. While it is natural to think of trust value associated with the social graphs, Sybil defenses have used the social graphs without this consideration. In this paper we study paramagnetic designs to tune the performance of Sybil defenses by accounting for trust in social graphs and modeling the trust as modified random walks. Our designs are motivated by the observed relationship between the algorithmic property required for the defenses to perform well and a hypothesized trust value in the underlying graphs."
ACM CCS 2010,"Secure encounter-based social networks - requirements, challenges, and designs.","In this paper we outline requirements, challenges, and designs for encounter-based mobile social networks, where relationships are based on a temporarily shared location. To illustrate the challenges we examine a recently proposed design, SMILE, against a set of functional and security requirements. We show that SMILE is vulnerable to several attacks such as impersonation, collusion, and privacy breaching, even though it was built with the explicit goal of resisting some of those attacks. With this in mind, we construct a flexible framework for secure mobile social networks, and describe how to use it in order to construct several networks which offer somewhat different security properties. Each of the designs is then examined against the ideal requirements where some are shown to outperform previous work."
ACM CCS 2010,DieHarder - securing the heap.,"Heap-based attacks depend on a combination of memory management error and an exploitable memory allocator. Many allocators include ad hoc countermeasures against particular exploits but their effectiveness against future exploits has been uncertain. This paper presents the first formal treatment of the impact of allocator design on security. It analyzes a range of widely-deployed memory allocators, including those used by Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD, and shows that they remain vulnerable to attack. It them presents DieHarder, a new allocator whose design was guided by this analysis. DieHarder provides the highest degree of security from heap-based attacks of any practical allocator of which we are aware while imposing modest performance overhead. In particular, the Firefox web browser runs as fast with DieHarder as with the Linux allocator."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure online banking on untrusted computers.,"Frauds and attacks for online banking are increasing quickly. The major platform for current online banking, personal computer, has become untrusted especially under malware attacks. In this study, we design a smart card-based solution called secure online banking companion (SOBC) to address this problem. Portability and cost are also highly considered in the design. We have implemented a prototype of the solution on a Java Card simulator, which shows the solution can be implemented easily using current smart card technologies."
ACM CCS 2010,iFriendU - leveraging 3-cliques to enhance infiltration attacks in online social networks.,"Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as Facebook have become ubiquitous in the past few years, counting hundreds of millions of people as members. OSNs allow users to form friendship relationships, join groups, communicate and share information with friends. The tremendous popularity of OSNs has naturally made them an appealing target for privacy compromising attacks. In this abstract we propose a novel attack against tightly knit OSN communities. Such (artificial) communities consist of users that know well each other and that are reluctant to accept other users as friends. Becoming a member of such a community may be only a first milestone for the attacker. Harvesting private information of members of such communities and following up with offline attacks may be the longer term benefit."
ACM CCS 2010,Modeling attacks on physical unclonable functions.,"We show in this paper how several proposed Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) can be broken by numerical modeling attacks. Given a set of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) of a PUF, our attacks construct a computer algorithm which behaves indistinguishably from the original PUF on almost all CRPs. This algorithm can subsequently impersonate the PUF, and can be cloned and distributed arbitrarily. This breaks the security of essentially all applications and protocols that are based on the respective PUF. The PUFs we attacked successfully include standard Arbited PUFs and Ring Oscillator PUFs of arbitrary sizes, and XO Arbiter PUFs, Lightweight Secure PUFs, and Feed-Forward Arbiter PUFs of up to a given size and complexity. Our attacks are based upon various machine learning techniques including Logistic Regression and Evolution Strategies. Our work leads to new design requirements for secure electrical PUFs, and will be useful to PUF designers and attackers alike."
ACM CCS 2010,Worry-free encryption - functional encryption with public keys.,"In this work, we put forward the notion of Worry-Free Encryption. This allows Alice to encrypt confidential information under Bob's public key and send it to him, without having to worry about whether Bob has the authority to actually access this information. This is done by encrypting the message under a hidden access policy that only allows Bob to decrypt if his credentials satisfy the policy. Our notion can be seen as a functional encryption scheme but in a public-key setting. As such, we are able to insist that even if the credential authority is corrupted, it should not be able to compromise the security of any honest user."
ACM CCS 2010,Demonstrating cognitive packet network resilience to worm attacks.,"The need for network stability and reliability has led to the growth of autonomic networks that can provide more stable and more reliable communications via on-line measurement, learning and adaptation. A promising architecture is the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) that rapidly adapts to varying network conditions and user requirements using QoS driven reinforcement learning algorithms that drive the routing control. Contrary to conventional mechanisms, the users rather than the nodes, control the routing by specifying their desired QoS requirements (QoS Goals), such as Minimum Delay, Maximum Bandwidth, Minimum Cost, etc., and the network then routes each user's traffic individually based on their specific needs and on a ""glocal"" view. In CPN the user has the ability to explore the network for its own needs, and evaluate its own impact on the network as a whole and vice-versa, and then take appropriate decisions. CPN routing has been evaluated extensively under normal operating conditions and has proven to be very adaptive to network changes such as congestion. Here we show how CPN can respond and survive to catastrophic node failures caused by the spread of network worms. This survival is based on two complementary approaches that are run concurrently: one the one hand, each user attempts to concurrently and adaptively avoid paths which are infected, and secondly patching algorithms are continuously run to repair the network. Experiments show that this approach assures the stability of network communications throughout the course of an attack."
ACM CCS 2010,Survivable key compromise in software update systems.,"Today's software update systems have little or no defense against key compromise. As a result, key compromises have put millions of software update clients at risk. Here we identify three classes of information whose authenticity and integrity are critical for secure software updates. Analyzing existing software update systems with our framework, we find their ability to communicate this information securely in the event of a key compromise to be weak or nonexistent. We also find that the security problems in current software update systems are compounded by inadequate trust revocation mechanisms. We identify core security principles that allow software update systems to survive key compromise. Using these ideas, we design and implement TUF, a software update framework that increases resilience to key compromise."
ACM CCS 2010,Losing control of the internet - using the data plane to attack the control plane.,"In this work, we introduce the Coordinated Cross Plane Session Termination, or CXPST, attack, a distributed denial of service attack that attacks the control plane of the Internet. CXPST extends previous work that demonstrates a vulnerability in routers that allows an adversary to disconnect a pair of routers using only data plane traffic. By carefully choosing BGP sessions to terminate, CXPST generates a surge of BGP updates that are seen by nearly all core routers on the Internet. This surge of updates surpasses the computational capacity of affected routers, crippling their ability to make routing decisions"
ACM CCS 2010,Size-based scheduling - a recipe for DDOS?,"Internet traffic measurements have shown that the majority of the Internet's flows are short, while a small percentage of the largest flows are responsible for most of the bytes. To exploit this property for performance improvement in routers and Web servers, several studies have proposed size-based schedulings to offer preferential treatment to the shortest flows. In this work, we present analytical and simulation results which confirm that size-based scheduling will ease the task of launching DDOS attacks on the Internet."
ACM CCS 2010,Robusta - taming the native beast of the JVM.,"Java applications often need to incorporate native-code components for efficiency and for reusing legacy code. However, it is well known that the use of native code defeats Java's security model. We describe the design and implementation of Robusta, a complete framework that provides safety and security to native code in Java applications. Starting from software-based fault isolation (SFI), Robusta isolates native code into a sandbox where dynamic linking/loading of libraries in supported and unsafe system modification and confidentiality violations are prevented. It also mediates native system calls according to a security policy by connecting to Java's security manager. Our prototype implementation of Robusta is based onNative Client and OpenJDK. Experiments in this prototype demonstrate Robusta is effective and efficient, with modest runtime overhead on a set of JNI benchmark programs. Robusta can be used to sandbox native libraries used in Java's system classes to prevent attackers from exploiting bugs in the libraries. It can also enable trustworthy execution of mobile Java programs with native libraries. The design of Robusta should also be applicable when other type-safe languages (e.g., C#, Python) want to ensure safe interoperation with native libraries"
ACM CCS 2010,Developing security protocols by refinement.,"We propose a development method for security protocols based on stepwise refinement. Our refinement strategy guides the transformation of abstract security goals into protocols that are secure when operating over an insecure channel controlled by a Dolev-Yao-style intruder. The refinement steps successively introduce local states, an intruder, communication channels with security properties, and cryptographic operations realizing these channels. The abstractions used provide insights on how the protocols work and foster the development of families of protocols sharing a common structure and properties. In contrast to post-hoc verification methods, protocols are developed together with their correctness proofs. We have implemented our method in Isabelle/HOL and used it to develop different entity authentication and key transport protocols."
ACM CCS 2010,In God we trust all others we monitor.,"Modern x86 platforms offer stealth capabilities, that are exploited by rootkits to hide malicious code as shown by the rootkit evolution. Recently, security researchers discovered a very powerful execution environment for rootkits that is isolated from the actual x86 host platform. According to the capabilities of the isolated environment the researches called it ""ring -3"". Security mechanisms, such as antivirus software, cannot reveal ""ring -3"" rootkits, since they are executed in the operating system which makes them unable to access ""ring -3""."
ACM CCS 2010,User-friendly matching protocol for online social networks.,"In this paper, we outline a privacy-preserving matching protocol for OSN (online social network) users to find their potential friends. With the proposed protocol, a logged-in user can match her profile with that of an off-line stranger, while both profiles are maximally protected. Our solution successfully eliminates the requirement of ""out-of-band"" communication channels, which is one of the biggest obstacles facing cryptographic solutions for OSNs."
ACM CCS 2010,An improved algorithm for tor circuit scheduling.,"Tor is a popular anonymity-preserving network, consisting of routers run by volunteers all around the world. It protects Internet users' privacy by relaying their network traffic through a series of routers, thus concealing the linkage between the sender and the recipient. Despite the advantage of Tor's anonymizing capabilities, it also brings extra latency, which discourages more users from joining the network."
ACM CCS 2010,Hierarchical attribute-based encryption for fine-grained access control in cloud storage services.,"Cloud computing, as an emerging computing paradigm, enables users to remotely store their data into a cloud so as to enjoy scalable services on-demand. Especially for small and medium-sized enterprises with limited budgets, they can achieve cost savings and productivity enhancements by using cloud-based services to manage projects, to make collaborations, and the like. However, allowing cloud service providers (CSPs), which are not in the same trusted domains as enterprise users, to take care of confidential data, may raise potential security and privacy issues. To keep the sensitive user data confidential against untrusted CSPs, a natural way is to apply cryptographic approaches, by disclosing decryption keys only to authorized users. However, when enterprise users outsource confidential data for sharing on cloud servers, the adopted encryption system should not only support fine-grained access control, but also provide high performance, full delegation, and scalability, so as to best serve the needs of accessing data anytime and anywhere, delegating within enterprises, and achieving a dynamic set of users. In this paper, we propose a scheme to help enterprises to efficiently share confidential data on cloud servers. We achieve this goal by first combining the hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) system and the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) system, and then making a performance-expressivity tradeoff, finally applying proxy re-encryption and lazy re-encryption to our scheme."
ACM CCS 2010,In search of an anonymous and secure lookup - attacks on structured peer-to-peer anonymous communication systems.,"The ability to locate random relays is a key challenge for peer-to-peer (P2P) anonymous communication systems. Earlier attempts like Salsa and AP3 used distributes hash table lookups to locate relays, but the lack of anonymity in their lookup mechanisms enables an adversary to infer the path structure and compromise used anonymity. NISAN and Torsk are state-of-the-art systems for P2P anonymous communication. Their designs include mechanisms that are specifically tailored to mitigate information leak attacks. NISAN proposes to add anonymity into the lookup mechanism itself, while Torsk proposes the use of secret buddy nodes to anonymize the lookup initiator. In this paper, we attack the key mechanisms that hide the relationship between a lookup initiator and its selected relays in NISAN and Torsk. We present passive attacks on the NISAN lookup and show that it is not as anonymous as previously thought. We analyze three circuit construction mechanisms for anonymous communication using the NISAN lookup, and show that the information leaks in the NISAN lookup lead to a significant reduction in user anonymity. We also propose active attacks on Torsk that defeat its secret buddy mechanism and consequently compromise user anonymity. Our results are backed up by probabilistic modeling and extensive simulations. Our study motivates the search for a DHT lookup mechanism that is both secure and anonymous."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure dynamic code generation against spraying.,"DCG (Dynamic Code Generation) technologies have found widely applications in the Web 2.0 era, Dion Blazakis recently presented a Flash JIT-Spraying attack against Adobe Flash Player that easily circumvented DEP and ASLR protection mechanisms built in modern operating systems. We have generalized and extended JIT Spraying into DCG Spraying. Based our analyses on this abstract model of DCG Spraying, we have found that all mainstream DCG implementations (Java/ JavaScript/ Flash/ .Net/ SilverLight) are vulnerable against DCG Spraying attack, and none of the existing ad hoc defenses such as compilation optimization, random NOP padding and constant splitting provides effective protection. Furthermore, we propose a new protection method, INSeRT, which combines randomization of intrinsic elements of machine instructions and randomly planted special trapping snippets. INSeRT practically renders the ""sprayed code"" ineffective, while alerts the host program of ongoing attacking attempts. We implemented a prototype of INSeRT on the V8 JavaScript engine, and the performance overhead is less than 5%, which should be acceptable in practical application."
ACM CCS 2010,Testing metrics for password creation policies by attacking large sets of revealed passwords.,"In this paper we attempt to determine the effectiveness of using entropy, as defined in NIST SP800-63, as a measurement of the security provided by various password creation policies. This is accomplished by modeling the success rate of current password cracking techniques against real user passwords. These data sets were collected from several different websites, the largest one containing over 32 million passwords. This focus on actual attack methodologies and real user passwords quite possibly makes this one of the largest studies on password security to date. In addition we examine what these results mean for standard password creation policies, such as minimum password length, and character set requirements."
ACM CCS 2010,Security analysis of India&apos;s electronic voting machines.,"Elections in India are conducted almost exclusively using electronic voting machines developed over the past two decades by a pair of government-owned companies. These devices, known in India as EVMs, have been praised for their simple design, ease of use, and reliability, but recently they have also been criticized following widespread reports of election irregularities. Despite this criticism, many details of the machines' design have never been publicly disclosed, and they have not been subjected to a rigorous, independent security evaluation. In this paper, we present a security analysis of a real Indian EVM obtained from an anonymous source. We describe the machine's design and operation in detail, and we evaluate its security in light of relevant election procedures. We conclude that in spite of the machines' simplicity and minimal software trusted computing base, they are vulnerable to serious attacks that can alter election results and violate the secrecy of the ballot. We demonstrate two attacks, implemented using custom hardware, which could be carried out by dishonest election insiders or other criminals with only brief physical access to the machines. This case study carries important lessons for Indian elections and for electronic voting security more generally."
ACM CCS 2010,Mimimorphism - a new approach to binary code obfuscation.,"Binary obfuscation plays an essential role in evading malware static analysis and detection. The widely used code obfuscation techniques, such as polymorphism and metamorphism, focus on evading syntax based detection. However, statistic test and semantic analysis techniques have been developed to thwart their evasion attempts. More recent binary obfuscation techniques are divided in their purposes of attacking either statistical or semantic approach, but not both. In this paper, we introduce mimimorphism, a novel binary obfuscation technique with the potential of evading both statistical and semantic detections. Mimimorphic malware uses instruction-syntax-aware high-order mimic functions to transform its binary into mimicry executables that exhibit high similarity to benign programs in terms of statistical properties and semantic characteristics. We implement a prototype of the mimimorphic engine on the Intel x86 platform, and evaluate its capability of evading statistical anomaly detection and semantic analysis detection techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that the mimicry executables are indistinguishable from benign programs in terms of byte frequency distribution and entropy, as well as control flow fingerprint."
ACM CCS 2010,Ad hoc broadcast encryption.,"Numerous applications in ad hoc networks, peer-to-peer networks, and on-the-fly data sharing call for confidential broadcast without relying on a dealer. To cater for such applications, we propose a new primitive referred to as ad hoc broadcast encryption (AHBE), in which each user possesses a public key and, upon seeing the public keys of the users, a sender can securely broadcast to any subset of them, so that only the intended users can decrypt. We implement a concrete AHBE scheme proven secure under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE) assumption. The resulting scheme has sub-linear complexity, comparable to up-to-date broadcast systems which have also sub-linear complexity but require a fully trusted dealer."
ACM CCS 2010,A control point for reducing root abuse of file-system privileges.,"We address the problem of restricting root's ability to change arbitrary files on disk, in order to prevent abuse on most current desktop operating systems. The approach first involves recognizing and separating out the ability to configure a system from the ability to use the system to perform tasks. The permission to modify configuration of the system is then further subdivided in order to restrict applications from modifying the file-system objects of other applications. We explore the division of root's current ability to change arbitrary files on disk and discuss a prototype that proves out the viability of the approach for designated system-wide file-system objects. Our architecture exposes a control point available for use to enforce policies that prevent one application from modifying another's file-system objects. In addition, we review in detail the permissions given to current installers, and alternative approaches for secure software installation."
ACM CCS 2010,Dynamic window based multihop authentication for WSN.,"Per-hop authentication is the most effective way to prevent DOS attacks during multihop data delivery. Although the study results show that Public Key Cryptography (PKC) is feasible on sensor nodes with limited resources, it is still very expensive to perform per-hop authentication using public key digital signature. To solve the problem that the resources of WSN is exhausted quickly by PKC, Dynamic Window Based Multihop Authentication(DWMA) for WSN is proposed in this paper. Dynamic window makes it possible to pay only a small number of authentication based on digital signature for confining DoS attacks effectively in a small scope and locating suspicious nodes quickly. Experimental results show that DWMA could save more resources than per-hop authentication for WSN, defend DoS attacks effectively and locate malicious nodes. It's an effective protocol for ensuring the resistance of DoS in routing."
ACM CCS 2010,Spectrum based fraud detection in social networks.,"Social networks are vulnerable to various attacks such as spam emails, viral marketing and the such. In this paper we develop a spectrum based detection framework to discover the perpetrators of these attacks. In particular, we focus on Random Link Attacks (RLAs) in which the malicious user creates multiple false identities and interactions among those identities to later proceed to attack the regular members of the network. We show that RLA attackers can be filtered by using their spectral coordinate characteristics, which are hard to hide even after the efforts by the attackers of resembling as much as possible the rest of the network. Experimental results show that our technique is very effective in detecting those attackers and outperforms techniques previously published."
ACM CCS 2010,Practical leakage-resilient pseudorandom generators.,"Cryptographic systems and protocols are the core of many Internet security procedures (such as SSL, SSH, IPSEC, DNSSEC, secure mail, etc.). At the heart of all cryptographic functions is a good source of randomness, and for efficiency, the primitive of pseudorandom generator (PRG). PRG can also be used in the design of stream ciphers, for secure communications. The Internet is nowadays composed of many types of devices with very different hardware and software characteristics. Hence, one of the concerns in such open environments is the information ""leakage"" and its exploitation via the so-called ""side channel attacks""."
ACM CCS 2010,A portable TPM based on USB key.,"Trusted computing technology aims to enhance the security of platform by the TPM. But there are some drawbacks of TCG's Trusted Computing architecture for user-based applications. This paper presents a new concept of portable TPM (PTM) based on USB Key to solve those problems. At first, we use PTM to establish a trusted path between the verifier and the user in remote attestation so as to propagate the trust chain to the end user. Secondly, we design the trust model and platform management mechanism of PTM. In this model the single point failure of TPM and frequent sensitive data migrations between different platforms are avoided based on PTM. At last, we implement the PTM on the USB Key with Java Card Runtime Environment. The test results show that the PTM scheme is feasible for user-based application."
ACM CCS 2010,Sidebuster - automated detection and quantification of side-channel leaks in web application development.,"A web application is a ""two-part"" program, with its components deployed both in the browser and in the web server. The communication between these two components inevitably leaks out the program's internal states to those eavesdropping on its web traffic, simply through the side channel features of the communication such as packet length and timing, even if the traffic is entirely encrypted. Our recent study shows that such side-channel leaks are both fundamental and realistic: a set of popular web applications are found to disclose highly sensitive user data such as one's family incomes, health profiles, investment secrets and more through their side channels. Our study also shows that an significant improvement of the current web-application development practice is necessary to mitigate this threat. To answer this urgent call, we present in this paper a suite of new techniques for automatic detection and quantification of side-channel leaks in web applications. Our approach, called Sidebuster, can automatically analyze an application's source code to detect its side channels and then perform a rerun test to assess the amount of information disclosed through such channels (quantified as the entropy loss). Sidebuster has been designed to work on event-driven applications and can effectively handle the AJAX GUI widgets used in most web applications. In our research, we implemented a prototype of our technique for analyzing GWT applications and evaluated it using complicated web applications. Our study shows that Sidebuster can effectively identify the side-channel leaks in these applications and assess their severity, with a small overhead."
ACM CCS 2010,The security of modern password expiration - an algorithmic framework and empirical analysis.,"This paper presents the first large-scale study of the success of password expiration in meeting its intended purpose, namely revoking access to an account by an attacker who has captured the account's password. Using a dataset of over 7700 accounts, we assess the extent to which passwords that users choose to replace expired ones pose an obstacle to the attacker's continued access. We develop a framework by which an attacker can search for a user's new password from an old one, and design an efficient algorithm to build an approximately optimal search strategy. We then use this strategy to measure the difficulty of breaking newly chosen passwords from old ones. We believe our study calls into question the merit of continuing the practice of password expiration."
ACM CCS 2010,On efficient ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption and broadcast encryption - extended abstract.,"Existing CP-ABE schemes incur very large ciphertext size, which increases linearly with respect to the number of attributes in the access policy. Large ciphertext prevents CP-ABE from being adopted in the communication constrained environments. In this paper, we proposed a new construction of CP-ABE, named Constant-size CP-ABE (denoted as CCP-ABE) that significantly reduces the ciphertext to a constant size for an AND gate access policy with any given number of attributes. Each ciphertext in CCP-ABE requires only elements on a bilinear group."
ACM CCS 2010,Efficient provable data possession for hybrid clouds.,"Provable data possession is a technique for ensuring the integrity of data in outsourcing storage service. In this paper, we propose a cooperative provable data possession scheme in hybrid clouds to support scalability of service and data migration, in which we consider the existence of multiple cloud service providers to cooperatively store and maintain the clients' data. Our experiments show that the verification of our scheme requires a small, constant amount of overhead, which minimizes communication complexity."
ACM CCS 2010,Attacks and design of image recognition CAPTCHAs.,"We systematically study the design of image recognition CAPTCHAs (IRCs) in this paper. We first review and examine all existing IRCs schemes and evaluate each scheme against the practical requirements in CAPTCHA applications, particularly in large-scale real-life applications such as Gmail and Hotmail. Then we present a security analysis of the representative schemes we have identified. For the schemes that remain unbroken, we present our novel attacks. For the schemes for which known attacks are available, we propose a theoretical explanation why those schemes have failed. Next, we provide a simple but novel framework for guiding the design of robust IRCs. Then we propose an innovative IRC called Cortcha that is scalable to meet the requirements of large-scale applications. It relies on recognizing objects by exploiting the surrounding context, a task that humans can perform well but computers cannot. An infinite number of types of objects can be used to generate challenges, which can effectively disable the learning process in machine learning attacks. Cortcha does not require the images in its image database to be labeled. Image collection and CAPTCHA generation can be fully automated. Our usability studies indicate that, compared with Google's text CAPTCHA, Cortcha allows a slightly higher human accuracy rate but on average takes more time to solve a challenge."
ACM CCS 2010,A cloud based SIM DRM scheme for the mobile internet.,"With the rapid growth of the mobile industry, a considerable amount of mobile applications and services are available. Meanwhile, pirates and illegal distributions of digital contents have become serious issues. Digital Rights Management (DRM) aims at protecting digital contents from being abused through regulating the usage of digital contents. In this paper, a cloud based SIM DRM scheme, called CS-DRM, is proposed for the mobile Internet. Also, a prototype of our DRM scheme is implemented to demonstrate the correctness, effectiveness and efficiency of CS-DRM.",

ACM CCS 2010,"Synchronized aggregate signatures - new definitions, constructions and applications.","An aggregate signature scheme is a digital signature scheme where anyone given n signatures on n messages from n users can aggregate all these signatures into a single short signature. Unfortunately, no ""fully non-interactive"" aggregate signature schemes are known outside of the random oracle heuristic; that is, signers must pass messages between themselves, sequentially or otherwise, to generate the signature. Interaction is too costly for some interesting applications."
ACM CCS 2010,Predictive black-box mitigation of timing channels.,"We investigate techniques for general black-box mitigation of timing channels. The source of events is wrapped by a timing mitigator that delays output events so that they contain only a bounded amount of information. We introduce a general class of timing mitigators that can achieve any given bound on timing channel leakage, with a tradeoff in system performance. We show these mitigators compose well with other mechanisms for information flow control, and demonstrate they are effective against some known timing attacks."
ACM CCS 2010,HyperSentry - enabling stealthy in-context measurement of hypervisor integrity.,"This paper presents HyperSentry, a novel framework to enable integrity measurement of a running hypervisor (or any other highest privileged software layer on a system). Unlike existing solutions for protecting privileged software, HyperSentry does not introduce a higher privileged software layer below the integrity measurement target, which could start another race with malicious attackers in obtaining the highest privilege in the system. Instead, HyperSentry introduces a software component that is properly isolated from the hypervisor to enable stealthy and in-context measurement of the runtime integrity of the hypervisor. While stealthiness is necessary to ensure that a compromised hypervisor does not have a chance to hide the attack traces upon detecting an up-coming measurement, in-context measurement is necessary to retrieve all the needed inputs for a successful integrity measurement."
ACM CCS 2010,Computationally sound verification of source code.,"Increasing attention has recently been given to the formal verification of the source code of cryptographic protocols. The standard approach is to use symbolic abstractions of cryptography that make the analysis amenable to automation. This leaves the possibility of attacks that exploit the mathematical properties of the cryptographic algorithms themselves. In this paper, we show how to conduct the protocol analysis on the source code level (F# in our case) in a computationally sound way, i.e., taking into account cryptographic security definitions."
ACM CCS 2010,PinDr0p - using single-ended audio features to determine call provenance.,"The recent diversification of telephony infrastructure allows users to communicate through landlines, mobile phones and VoIP phones. However, call metadata such as Caller-ID is either not transferred or transferred without verification across these networks, allowing attackers to maliciously alter it. In this paper, we develop PinDr0p, a mechanism to assist users in determining call provenance - the source and the path taken by a call. Our techniques detect and measure single-ended audio features to identify all of the applied voice codecs, calculate packet loss and noise profiles, while remaining agnostic to characteristics of the speaker's voice (as this may legitimately change when interacting with a large organization). In the absence of verifiable call metadata, these features in combination with machine learning allow us to determine the traversal of a call through as many as three different providers (e.g., cellular, then VoIP, then PSTN and all combinations and subsets thereof) with 91.6% accuracy. Moreover, we show that once we identify and characterize the networks traversed, we can create detailed fingerprints for a call source. Using these fingerprints we show that we are able to distinguish between calls made using specific PSTN, cellular, Vonage, Skype and other hard and soft phones from locations across the world with over 90% accuracy. In so doing, we provide a first step in accurately determining the provenance of a call."
ACM CCS 2010,A methodology for empirical analysis of permission-based security models and its application to android.,"Permission-based security models provide controlled access to various system resources. The expressiveness of the permission set plays an important role in providing the right level of granularity in access control. In this work, we present a methodology for the empirical analysis of permission-based security models which makes novel use of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm of Kohonen (2001). While the proposed methodology may be applicable to a wide range of architectures, we analyze 1,100 Android applications as a case study. Our methodology is of independent interest for visualization of permission-based systems beyond our present Android-specific empirical analysis. We offer some discussion identifying potential points of improvement for the Android permission model attempting to increase expressiveness where needed without increasing the total number of permissions or overall complexity."
ACM CCS 2010,Computational indistinguishability logic.,"Computational Indistinguishability Logic (CIL) is a logic for reasoning about cryptographic primitives in computational models. It captures reasoning patterns that are common in provable security, such as simulations and reductions. CIL is sound for the standard model, but also supports reasoning in the random oracle and other idealized models."
ACM CCS 2010,Enhancing resilience of probabilistic key pre-distribution schemes for WSNs through hash chaining.,"We propose, in this paper, a novel class of probabilistic key pre-distribution schemes highly resilient against node capture. We introduce a new approach to enhance resilience by concealing keys through the use of a simple hash chaining mechanism. We provide analytical analysis which shows that our solution enhances the network resilience against node capture without introducing a new overhead comparatively to similar solutions in the literature."
ACM CCS 2010,NoTamper - automatic blackbox detection of parameter tampering opportunities in web applications.,"Web applications rely heavily on client-side computation to examine and validate form inputs that are supplied by a user (e.g., ""credit card expiration date must be valid""). This is typically done for two reasons: to reduce burden on the server and to avoid latencies in communicating with the server. However, when a server fails to replicate the validation performed on the client, it is potentially vulnerable to attack. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically detecting potential server-side vulnerabilities of this kind in existing (legacy) web applications through blackbox analysis. We discuss the design and implementation of NoTamper, a tool that realizes this approach. NoTamper has been employed to discover several previously unknown vulnerabilities in a number of open-source web applications and live web sites."
ACM CCS 2010,TAPS - automatically preparing safe SQL queries.,We present the first sound program transformation approach for automatically transforming the code of a legacy web application to employ PREPARE statements in place of unsafe SQL queries. Our approach therefore opens the way for eradicating the SQL injection threat vector from legacy web applications. This extended abstract is based on our paper[4] that appeared in the Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC'2010) conference.
ACM CCS 2010,Algebraic pseudorandom functions with improved efficiency from the augmented cascade.,"We construct an algebraic pseudorandom function (PRF) that is more efficient than the classic Naor-Reingold algebraic PRF. Our PRF is the result of adapting the cascade construction, which is the basis of HMAC, to the algebraic settings. To do so we define an augmented cascade and prove it secure when the underlying PRF satisfies a property called parallel security. We then use the augmented cascade to build new algebraic PRFs. The algebraic structure of our PRF leads to an efficient large-domain Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and a large-domain simulatable VRF."
ACM CCS 2010,Attacking and fixing PKCS#11 security tokens.,"We show how to extract sensitive cryptographic keys from a variety of commercially available tamper resistant cryptographic security tokens, exploiting vulnerabilities in their RSA PKCS#11 based APIs. The attacks are performed by Tookan, an automated tool we have developed, which reverse-engineers the particular token in use to deduce its functionality, constructs a model of its API for a model checker, and then executes any attack trace found by the model checker directly on the token. We describe the operation of Tookan and give results of testing the tool on 17 commercially available tokens: 9 were vulnerable to attack, while the other 8 had severely restricted functionality. One of the attacks found by the model checker has not previously appeared in the literature. We show how Tookan may be used to verify patches to insecure devices, and give a secure configuration that we have implemented in a patch to a software token simulator. This is the first such configuration to appear in the literature that does not require any new cryptographic mechanisms to be added to the standard. We comment on lessons for future key management APIs."
ACM CCS 2010,Protecting portable storage with host validation.,"Portable storage devices, such as key-chain USB devices, are ubiquitous and used everywhere; users repeatedly use the same storage device in open computer laboratories, Internet cafes, and on office and home computers. Consequently, they are the target of malware that exploit the data present or use them as a means to propagate malicious software., e.g., Conficker and Agent.bz. We present the Kells mobile storage system, which limits untrusted or unknown systems from accessing sensitive data by continuously validating the accessing host's integrity state. We explore the design and operation of Kells, and implement a proof-of-concept USB 2.0 storage device of experimental hardware. Our experiments indicate nominal overheads associated with host validation, with a worst-case throughput overhead of 1.22% for reads and 2.78% for writes."
ACM CCS 2010,Input generation via decomposition and re-stitching - finding bugs in Malware.,"Attackers often take advantage of vulnerabilities in benign software, and the authors of benign software must search their code for bugs in hopes of finding vulnerabilities before they are exploited. But there has been little research on the converse question of whether defenders can turn the tables by finding vulnerabilities in malware. We provide a first affirmative answer to that question. We introduce a new technique, stitched dynamic symbolic execution, that makes it possible to use exploration techniques based on symbolic execution in the presence of functionalities that are common in malware and otherwise hard to analyze, such as decryption and checksums. The technique is based on decomposing the constraints induced by a program, solving only a subset, and then re-stitching the constraint solution into a complete input. We implement the approach in a system for x86 binaries, and apply it to 4 prevalent families of bots and other malware. We find 6 bugs that could be exploited by a network attacker to terminate or subvert the malware. These bugs have persisted across malware revisions for months, and even years. We discuss the possible applications and ethical considerations of this new capability"
ACM CCS 2010,Virtual browser - a web-level sandbox to secure third-party JavaScript without sacrificing functionality.,"Third-party JavaScript offers much more diversity to Web and its applications but also introduces new threats. Those scripts cannot be completely trusted and executed with the privileges given to host web sites. Due to incomplete virtualization and lack of tracking all the data flows, all the existing works in this area can secure only a subset of third-party JavaScript. At the same time, because of the existence of not so well documented browser quirks, attacks may be encoded in non standard HTML/JavaScript so that they can bypass existing approaches as these approaches will parse third-party JavaScript twice, at both server and client side."
ACM CCS 2010,Retaining sandbox containment despite bugs in privileged memory-safe code.,"Flaws in the standard libraries of secure sandboxes represent a major security threat to billions of devices worldwide. The standard libraries are hard to secure because they frequently need to perform low-level operations that are forbidden in untrusted application code. Existing designs have a single, large trusted computing base that contains security checks at the boundaries between trusted and untrusted code. Unfortunately, flaws in the standard library often allow an attacker to escape the security protections of the sandbox."
ACM CCS 2010,Platform-independent programs.,"Given a single program (i.e., bit string), one may assume that the program's behaviors can be determined by first identifying the native runtime architecture and then executing the program on that architecture. In this paper, we challenge the notion that programs run on a single architecture by developing techniques that automatically create a single program string that a) runs on different architectures, and b) potentially has different behaviors depending upon which architecture it runs on. At a high level, a primary security implication is that any program analysis done on a program must only be considered valid for the assumed architecture. Our techniques also introduce a new type of steganography that hides execution behaviors. In order to demonstrate our techniques, we implement a system for generating platform-independent programs for x86, ARM, and MIPS. We use our system to generate real platform-independent programs."
ACM CCS 2010,CardSpace in the cloud.,"This paper describes a web based federated identity management system which is based on the user centric approach of the Information Card model, and has been enhanced to remove many of the problems inherent in Microsoft's original design. Furthermore the new design is adapted to interwork with existing SAML 2 federations. Our model supports not only improved user mobility and the aggregation of claims from multiple identity providers (IdPs), but also user authentication via just one of the IdPs without placing any constraints on the authentication mechanism that is used. This is achieved by introducing a new component, the Linking Identity Selector, which allows the user to select multiple cards at service provision time. Users can then use the combined set of credentials to access a wider range of web based resources. We describe our first example application which allows the user to present a credit card, a self asserted card, a hotel loyalty card and a frequent flyer card in order to make an online hotel booking, using voice biometrics for authentication."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure latency estimation with treeple.,"A network latency estimation scheme associates a ""position"" to every peer in a distributed network such that the latency between any two nodes can be accurately estimated from their positions. Applications for these schemes include efficient overlay construction, compact routing, anonymous route selection, and efficient byzantine agreement. We present a new latency estimation scheme, Treeple. Our scheme is different from existing ones in several aspects: Treeple is provably secure, rather than being able to resist known attacks; positions in Treeple are not Euclidean coordinates and reflect the underlying network topology; finally, positions in Treeple are accurate, stable, and can be assigned to peers not participating in the system."
ACM CCS 2010,Symbolic security analysis of ruby-on-rails web applications.,"Many of today's web applications are built on frameworks that include sophisticated defenses against malicious adversaries. However, mistakes in the way developers deploy those defenses could leave applications open to attack. To address this issue, we introduce Rubyx, a symbolic executor that we use to analyze Ruby-on-Rails web applications for security vulnerabilities. Rubyx specifications can easily be adapted to variety of properties, since they are built from general assertions, assumptions, and object invariants. We show how to write Ruby specifications to detect susceptibility to cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery, insufficient authentication, leaks of secret information, insufficient access control, as well as application-specific security properties. We used Rubyx to check seven web applications from various sources against out specifications. We found many vulnerabilities, and each application was subject to at least one critical attack. Encouragingly, we also found that it was relatively easy to fix most vulnerabilities, and that Rubyx showed the absence of attacks after our fixes. Our results suggest that Rubyx is a promising new way to discover security vulnerabilities in Ruby-on-Rails web applications."
ACM CCS 2010,Return-oriented programming without returns.,"We show that on both the x86 and ARM architectures it is possible to mount return-oriented programming attacks without using return instructions. Our attacks instead make use of certain instruction sequences that behave like a return, which occur with sufficient frequency in large libraries on (x86) Linux and (ARM) Android to allow creation of Turing-complete gadget sets."
ACM CCS 2010,Inference and analysis of formal models of botnet command and control protocols.,"We propose a novel approach to infer protocol state machines in the realistic high-latency network setting, and apply it to the analysis of botnet Command and Control (C &C) protocols. Our proposed techniques enable an order of magnitude reduction in the number of queries and time needed to learn a botnet C &C protocol compared to classic algorithms (from days to hours for inferring the MegaD C &C protocol). We also show that the computed protocol state machines enable formal analysis for botnet defense, including finding the weakest links in a protocol, uncovering protocol design flaws, inferring the existence of unobservable communication back-channels among botnet servers, and finding deviations of protocol implementations which can be used for fingerprinting. We validate our technique by inferring the protocol state-machine from Postfix's SMTP implementation and comparing the inferred state-machine to the SMTP standard. Further, our experimental results offer new insights into MegaD's C &C, showing our technique can be used as a powerful tool for defense against botnets."
ACM CCS 2010,Practical leakage-resilient identity-based encryption from simple assumptions.,"We design the first Leakage-Resilient Identity-Based Encryption (LR-IBE) systems from static assumptions in the standard model. We derive these schemes by applying a hash proof technique from Alwen et.al. (Eurocrypt '10) to variants of the existing IBE schemes of Boneh-Boyen, Waters, and Lewko-Waters. As a result, we achieve leakage-resilience under the respective static assumptions of the original systems in the standard model, while also preserving the efficiency of the original schemes. Moreover, our results extend to the Bounded Retrieval Model (BRM), yielding the first regular and identity-based BRM encryption schemes from static assumptions in the standard model."
ACM CCS 2010,Dissecting one click frauds.,"""One Click Fraud"" is an online confidence scam that has been plaguing an increasing number of Japanese Internet users, in spite of new laws and the mobilization of police task forces. In this scam, the victim clicks on a link presented to them, only to be informed that they just entered a binding contract and are required to pay a registration fee for a service. Even though no money is legally owed, a large number of users prefer to pay up, because of potential embarrassment due to the type of service ""requested"" (e.g., pornographic goods)."
ACM CCS 2010,Dissent - accountable anonymous group messaging.,"Users often wish to participate in online groups anonymously, but misbehaving users may abuse this anonymity to disrupt the group's communication. Existing messaging protocols such as DC-nets leave groups vulnerable to denial-of-service and Sybil attacks, Mix-nets are difficult to protect against traffic analysis, and accountable voting protocols are unsuited to general anonymous messaging."
ACM CCS 2010,TEE - a virtual DRTM based execution environment for secure cloud-end computing.,"Cloud computing is believed to be the next major paradigm of computing because it will substantially reduce the cost of IT systems. Ensuring security in the cloud-end is necessary because customers' data are stored and processed there. Previous studies have mainly focused on secure cloud-end storage, whereas secure cloud-end computing is much less investigated. The current practice is solely based on Virtual Machines (VM), and cannot offer adequate security because the guest Operating Systems (OS) often can be easily breached (e.g., by exploiting their vulnerabilities). This motivates the need of solutions for more secure cloud-end computing. This poster presents the design, implementation and analysis of a candidate solution, called Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which takes advantage of both virtualization and trusted computing technologies simultaneously. The novelty behind TEE is the virtualization of the Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM)."
ACM CCS 2010,On the (in)security of IPsec in MAC-then-encrypt configurations.,"IPsec allows a huge amount of flexibility in the ways in which its component cryptographic mechanisms can be combined to build a secure communications service. This may be good for supporting different security requirements but is potentially bad for security. We demonstrate the reality of this by describing efficient, plaintext-recovering attacks against all configurations of IPsec in which integrity protection is applied {\em prior} to encryption -- so-called MAC-then-encrypt configurations. We report on the implementation of our attacks against a specific IPsec implementation, and reflect on the implications of our attacks for real-world IPsec deployments as well as for theoretical cryptography."
ACM CCS 2010,Laptop theft - a case study on the effectiveness of security mechanisms in open organizations.,"Organizations rely on physical, technical and procedural mechanisms to protect their IT systems. Of all IT systems, laptops are the probably the most troublesome to protect, since they are easy to remove and conceal. When the thief has physical possession of the laptop, it is difficult to protect the data inside. Organizations open to the public, such as hospitals and universities, are easy targets for laptop thieves, since every day many people wander in the premises."
ACM CCS 2010,Information security for sensors by overwhelming random sequences and permutations.,"We propose efficient schemes for information-theoretically secure key exchange in the Bounded Storage Model (BSM), where the adversary is assumed to have limited storage. Our schemes generate a secret One Time Pad (OTP) shared by the sender and the receiver,from a large number of public random bits produced by the sender or by an external source. Our schemes initially generate a small number of shared secret bits, using known techniques. We introduce a new method to expand a small number of shared bits to a much longer, shared key."
ACM CCS 2010,On verifying stateful dataflow processing services in large-scale cloud systems.,"Cloud computing needs to provide integrity assurance in order to support security sensitive application services such as critical dataflow processing. In this paper, we present a novel RObust Service Integrity Attestation (ROSIA) framework that can efficiently verify the integrity of stateful dataflow processing services and pinpoint malicious service providers within a large-scale cloud system. ROSIA achieves robustness by supporting stateful dataflow services such as windowed stream operators, and performing integrated consistency check to detect colluding attacks. We have implemented ROSIA on top of the IBM System S dataflow processing system and tested it on the NCSU virtual computing lab. Our experimental results show that our scheme is feasible and efficient for large-scale cloud systems."
ACM CCS 2010,A privacy recommendation wizard for users of social networking sites.,"Privacy is a huge problem for users of social networking sites. While sites like Facebook allow individual users to personalize fine-grained privacy settings, this has proven quite difficult for average users. This demonstration illustrates a machine learning privacy wizard, or recommendation tool, that we have built at the University of Michigan. The wizard is based on the underlying observation that real users conceive their privacy preferences (which friends should see which data items) based on an implicit structure. Thus, after asking the user a limited number of carefully-chosen questions, it is usually possible to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the user's privacy preferences. This model, in turn, can be used to recommend detailed privacy settings for the user. Our demonstration wizard runs as a third-party Facebook application. Conference attendees will be able to ""test-drive"" the wizard by installing it on their own Facebook accounts."
ACM CCS 2010,Assessing trust in uncertain information using Bayesian description logic.,"Decision makers (humans or software agents alike) are faced with the challenge of examining large volumes of information originating from heterogeneous sources with the goal of ascertaining trust in various pieces of information. In this paper we argue (using examples) that traditional trust models are limited in their data model by assuming a pair-wise numeric rating between two entities (e.g., eBay recommendations, Netflix movie rating, etc). We present a novel trust computational model for rich, complex and uncertain information encoded using Bayesian Description Logics. We present security and scalability tradeoffs that arise in the new model, and the results of an evaluation of the first prototype implementation under a variety attack scenarios."
ACM CCS 2010,Detecting and characterizing social spam campaigns.,"Online social networks (OSNs) are exceptionally useful collaboration and communication tools for millions of users and their friends. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, they are also extremely effective tools for executing spam campaigns and spreading malware."
ACM CCS 2010,"Dismantling SecureMemory, CryptoMemory and CryptoRF.","The Atmel chip families SecureMemory, CryptoMemory, and CryptoRF use a proprietary stream cipher to guarantee authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity. This paper describes the cipher in detail and points out several weaknesses. One is the fact that the three components of the cipher operate largely independently; another is that the intermediate output generated by two of those components is strongly correlated with the generated keystream. For SecureMemory, a single eavesdropped trace is enough to recover the secret key with probability 0.57 in 2^{39} cipher ticks. This is a factor of 2^{31.5} faster than a brute force attack. On a 2 GHz laptop, this takes around 10 minutes. With more traces, the secret key can be recovered with virtual certainty without significant additional cost in time. For CryptoMemory and CryptoRF, if one has 2640 traces it is possible to recover the key in 2^{52} cipher ticks, which is 2^{19} times faster than brute force. On a 50 machine cluster of 2 GHz quad-core machines this would take less than 2 days."
ACM CCS 2010,Building efficient fully collusion-resilient traitor tracing and revocation schemes.,"In [8,9] Boneh et al. presented the first fully collusion-resistant traitor tracing and trace & revoke schemes. These schemes are based on composite order bilinear groups and their security depends on the hardness of the subgroup decision assumption."
ACM CCS 2010,Fingerprinting websites using remote traffic analysis.,"Recent work has shown that traffic analysis of data carried on encrypted tunnels can be used to recover important semantic information. As one example, attackers can find out which website, or which page on a website, a user is accessing simply by monitoring the traffic patterns. We show that traffic analysis is a much greater threat to privacy than previously thought, as such attacks can be carried out remotely. In particular, we show that, to perform traffic analysis, adversaries do not need to directly observe the traffic patterns. Instead, they can send probes from a far-off vantage point that exploit a queuing side channel in routers."
ACM CCS 2010,@spam - the underground on 140 characters or less.,"In this work we present a characterization of spam on Twitter. We find that 8% of 25 million URLs posted to the site point to phishing, malware, and scams listed on popular blacklists. We analyze the accounts that send spam and find evidence that it originates from previously legitimate accounts that have been compromised and are now being puppeteered by spammers. Using clickthrough data, we analyze spammers' use of features unique to Twitter and the degree that they affect the success of spam. We find that Twitter is a highly successful platform for coercing users to visit spam pages, with a clickthrough rate of 0.13%, compared to much lower rates previously reported for email spam. We group spam URLs into campaigns and identify trends that uniquely distinguish phishing, malware, and spam, to gain an insight into the underlying techniques used to attract users."
ACM CCS 2010,A new framework for efficient password-based authenticated key exchange.,"Protocols for password-based authenticated key exchange (PAKE) allow two users who share only a short, low-entropy password to agree on a cryptographically strong session key. The challenge in designing such protocols is that they must be immune to off-line dictionary attacks in which an eavesdropping adversary exhaustively enumerates the dictionary of likely passwords in an attempt to match a password to the set of observed transcripts."
ACM CCS 2010,On pairing constrained wireless devices based on secrecy of auxiliary channels - the case of acoustic eavesdropping.,"Secure ""pairing"" of wireless devices based on auxiliary or out-of-band (OOB) - audio, visual or tactile - communication is a well-established research direction. Lack of good quality interfaces on or physical access to certain constrained devices (e.g., headsets, access points, medical implants) makes pairing a challenging problem in practice. Prior work shows that pairing of constrained devices based on authenticated OOB (A-OOB) channels can be prone to human errors that eventually translate into man-in-the-middle attacks. An alternative and more usable solution is to use OOB channel(s) that are authenticated as well as secret (AS-OOB). AS-OOB pairing can be achieved by simply transmitting the key or a short password over the AS-OOB channel, avoiding potential serious human errors."
ACM CCS 2010,Efficient sensor node authentication via 3GPP mobile communication networks.,"Energy efficiency is one of important issues in the resource constrained wireless sensor network. In this paper, we propose the authentication and key agreement protocol that efficiently reduces the overall computational and communication costs in the next generation converged network. The enhanced security procedures are operated through the mobile network in order to maximize the lifetime of the sensor networks and to apply the combined capabilities of both networks."
ACM CCS 2010,DIFC programs by automatic instrumentation.,"Decentralized information flow control (DIFC) operating systems provide applications with mechanisms for enforcing information flow policies for their data. However, significant obstacles keep such operating systems from achieving widespread adoption. One key obstacle is that DIFC operating systems provide only low-level mechanisms for allowing application programmers to enforce their desired policies. It can be difficult for the programmer to ensure that their use of these mechanisms enforces their high-level policies, while at the same time not breaking the underlying functionality of their application. These are issues both for programmers who would develop new applications for a DIFC operating system and for programmers who would port existing applications to a DIFC operating system. Our work significantly eases these tasks. We present as automatic technique that takes as input a program with no DIFC code, and two policies: one that specifies prohibited information flows and one that specifies flows that must be allowed. Our technique then produces a new version of the input program that satisfies the two policies. To evaluate out technique, we implemented it in an automatic tool, called Swim (for Secure What I Mean), and applied it to a set of real-world programs and policies. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that the technique is sufficiently expressive to produce programs for real-world policies, and that it can produce such programs efficiently. It thus represents a significant contribution towards developing systems with strong end-to-end information flow guarantees."
ACM CCS 2010,TASTY - tool for automating secure two-party computations.,"Secure two-party computation allows two untrusting parties to jointly compute an arbitrary function on their respective private inputs while revealing no information beyond the outcome. Existing cryptographic compilers can automatically generate secure computation protocols from high-level specifications, but are often limited in their use and efficiency of generated protocols as they are based on either garbled circuits or (additively) homomorphic encryption only."
ACM CCS 2010,Rendezvous tunnel for anonymous publishing.,"Many anonymous peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems have been proposed in recent years. One problem that remains open is how to protect the anonymity of all participating users, namely, reader, server and publisher. In this work we propose a novel solution for a P2P file sharing system. Our solution provides overall anonymity to all participating users."
ACM CCS 2010,Protecting browsers from cross-origin CSS attacks.,"Cross-origin CSS attacks use style sheet import to steal confidential information from a victim website, hijacking a user's existing authenticated session; existing XSS defenses are ineffective. We show how to conduct these attacks with any browser, even if JavaScript is disabled, and propose a client-side defense with little or no impact on the vast majority of web sites. We have implemented and deployed defenses in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari. Our defense proposal has also been adopted by Opera."
ACM CCS 2010,Exploiting social networking sites for spam.,"In the ongoing arms race between spammers and the multi-million dollar anti-spam industry, the number of unsolicited e-mail messages (better known as ""spam"") and phishing has increased heavily in the last decade. In this paper, we show that our novel friend-in-the-middle attack on social networking sites (SNSs) can be used to harvest social data in an automated fashion. This social data can then be exploited for large-scale attacks such as context-aware spam and social-phishing. We prove the feasibility of our attack exemplarily on Facebook and identify possible consequences based on a mathematical model and simulations. Alarmingly, all major SNSs are vulnerable to our attack as they fail to secure the network layer appropriately."
ACM CCS 2010,Mobile location tracking in metro areas - malnets and others.,"Digital wireless radios broadcast identification numbers that uniquely identify them. As has been previously observed, given the ubiquity with which people carry smartphones with their embedded WiFi radios powered on, comes the ability to track individuals' movements. The ability to use wireless radios for positioning has been previously observed and developed in to useful products. In these systems a user willingly geolocates themselves by providing identifiers to infrastructure hardware. In this paper we consider the converse question: what rates of monitoring by smartphones devices in a given metropolitan area are necessary to achieve different levels of involuntary geolocation. While previous work has looked at countermeasure that attempt to maintain privacy, no work has attempted to quantify the problem and risks. Using appropriate simulations we give the first quantitative support for the number and conditions of tracking devices necessary to track the locations of non-participant individuals in urban environments. We provide evidence that a small, but not insignificant, number of mobile devices can be used to track a majority of users during a significant fraction of their travel with current devices. We conclude that in the immediate future, malnets would require relatively high infection rates to pose a significant threat, but that voluntary networks, with perceived benefit can probably achieve the usage rates necessary to track individual movements of non-subscribed users to a high-degree of accuracy. Our results also suggest ubiquitous deployment of 802.11n in smartphones would make geolocation feasible by malnets"
ACM CCS 2010,An implementation of event and filter confidentiality in pub/sub systems and its application to e-health.,"The publish/subscribe model offers a loosely-coupled communication paradigm where applications interact indirectly and asynchronously. Publisher applications generate events that are forwarded to subscriber applications by a network of brokers. Subscribers register by specifying filters that brokers match against events as part of the routing process. Brokers might be deployed on untrusted servers where malicious entities can get access to events and filters. Supporting confidentiality of events and filters in this setting is still an open challenge. First of all, it is desirable that publishers and subscribers do not share secret keys, such a requirement being against the loose-coupling of the model. Second, brokers need to route events by matching encrypted events against encrypted filters. This should be possible even with very complex filters. Existing solutions do not fully address these issues. This work describes the implementation of a novel schema that supports (i) confidentiality for events and filters; (ii) filters that express very complex constraints on events even if brokers are not able to access any information on both events and filters; (iii) and finally, does not require publishers and subscribers to share keys. We then describe an e-Health application scenario for monitoring patients with chronic diseases and show how our encryption schema can be used to provide confidentiality of the patients' personal and medical data, and control who can receive the patients' data and under which conditions."
ACM CCS 2010,Privacy and robustness for data aggregation in wireless sensor networks.,No abstract available.
ACM CCS 2010,An empirical study of privacy-violating information flows in JavaScript web applications.,"The dynamic nature of JavaScript web applications has given rise to the possibility of privacy violating information flows. We present an empirical study of the prevalence of such flows on a large number of popular websites. We have (1) designed an expressive, fine-grained information flow policy language that allows us to specify and detect different kinds of privacy-violating flows in JavaScript code,(2) implemented a new rewriting-based JavaScript information flow engine within the Chrome browser, and (3) used the enhanced browser to conduct a large-scale empirical study over the Alexa global top 50,000 websites of four privacy-violating flows: cookie stealing, location hijacking, history sniffing, and behavior tracking. Our survey shows that several popular sites, including Alexa global top-100 sites, use privacy-violating flows to exfiltrate information about users' browsing behavior. Our findings show that steps must be taken to mitigate the privacy threat from covert flows in browsers."
ACM CCS 2010,Recruiting new tor relays with BRAIDS.,"Tor, a distributed Internet anonymizing system, relies on volunteers who run dedicated relays. Other than altruism, these volunteers have no incentive to run relays, causing a large disparity between the number of users and available relays. We introduce BRAIDS, a set of practical mechanisms that encourages users to run Tor relays, allowing them to earn credits redeemable for improved performance of both interactive and non-interactive Tor traffic. These performance incentives will allow Tor to support increasing resource demands with almost no loss in anonymity: BRAIDS is robust to well-known attacks. Using a simulation of 20,300 Tor nodes, we show that BRAIDS allows relays to achieve 75% lower latency than non-relays for interactive traffic, and 90% higher bandwidth utilization for non-interactive traffic."
ACM CCS 2010,Designing router scheduling policies - a privacy perspective.,"We examine a queuing side channel which results from a shared resource between two users in the context of packet networks. We consider the scenario where one of them is a legitimate user and the other is an attacker who is trying to learn about the former's activities. We show that the waiting time of an adversary sending a small but frequent probe stream to the shared resource (e.g., a router) is highly correlated with traffic pattern of the user."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure text processing with applications to private DNA matching.,"Motivated by the problem of private DNA matching, we consider the design of efficient protocols for secure text processing. Here, informally, a party P1 holds a text T and a party P2 holds a pattern p and some additional information y, and P2 wants to learn {f(T,j,y)} for all locations j where p is found as a substring in T. (In particular, this generalizes the basic pattern matching problem.) We aim for protocols with full security against a malicious P2 that also preserve privacy against a malicious P1 (i.e., one-sided security). We show how to modify Yao's garbled circuit approach to obtain a protocol where the size of the garbled circuit is linear in the number of occurrences of p in T (rather than linear in $|T|$). Along the way we show a new keyword search protocol that may be of independent interest."
ACM CCS 2010,CRAFT - a new secure congestion control architecture.,"Congestion control algorithms seek to optimally utilize network resources by allocating a certain rate for each user. However, malicious clients can disregard the congestion control algorithms implemented at the clients and induce congestion at bottleneck links. Thus, in an adversarial environment, the network must enforce the congestion control algorithm in order to attain the optimal network utilization offered by the algorithm. Prior work protects only a single link incident on the enforcement routers neglecting damage inflicted upon other downstream links. We present CRAFT, a capability-based scheme to secure all downstream links of a deploying router. Our goal is to enforce a network-wide congestion control algorithm on all flows. As a reference design, we develop techniques to enforce the TCP congestion control. Our design regulates all flows to share bandwidth resources in a TCP-fair manner by emulating the TCP state machine in a CRAFT router. As a result, once a flow passes a single CRAFT router, it is TCP-fair on all downstream links of that router."
ACM CCS 2010,Trail of bytes - efficient support for forensic analysis.,"For the most part, forensic analysis of computer systems requires that one first identify suspicious objects or events, and then examine them in enough detail to form a hypothesis as to their cause and effect. Sadly, while our ability to gather vast amounts of data has improved significantly over the past two decades, it is all too often the case that we tend to lack detailed information just when we need it the most. Simply put, the current state of computer forensics leaves much to be desired. In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromised has been detected."
ACM CCS 2010,Timing attacks on PIN input devices.,"Keypads are commonly used to enter personal identification numbers (PIN) which are intended to authenticate a user based on what they know. A number of those keypads such as ATM inputs and door keypads provide an audio feedback to the user for each button pressed. Such audio feedback are observable from a modest distance. We are looking at quantifying the information leaking from delays between acoustic feedback pulses. Preliminary experiments suggest that by using a Hidden Markov Model, it might be possible to substantially narrow the search space. A subsequent brute force search on the reduced search space could be possible with- out triggering alerts, lockouts or other mechanisms design to thwart plain brute force attempts."
ACM CCS 2010,Accountability - definition and relationship to verifiability.,"Many cryptographic tasks and protocols, such as non-repudiation, contract-signing, voting, auction, identity-based encryption, and certain forms of secure multi-party computation, involve the use of (semi-)trusted parties, such as notaries and authorities. It is crucial that such parties can be held accountable in case they misbehave as this is a strong incentive for such parties to follow the protocol. Unfortunately, there does not exist a general and convincing definition of accountability that would allow to assess the level of accountability a protocol provides."
ACM CCS 2010,AccessMiner - using system-centric models for malware protection.,"Models based on system calls are a popular and common approach to characterize the run-time behavior of programs. For example, system calls are used by intrusion detection systems to detect software exploits. As another example, policies based on system calls are used to sandbox applications or to enforce access control. Given that malware represents a significant security threat for today's computing infrastructure, it is not surprising that system calls were also proposed to distinguish between benign processes and malicious code."
ACM CCS 2010,SecTag - a multi-policy supported secure web tag framework.,"Traditional web application development often encounters tight coupling problem between access control logic and business logic. It is hard to configure and modify access control policies after a system has been deployed. In this demonstration, we present SecTag, a multi-policy supported secure web tag framework, to address this problem. We define a series of general-purpose secure attributes that meet the demand of fine-grained access control in web presentation layer. We also design a set of high interactive secure tags, which encapsulate secure features to provide reusable secure components for web development. A running example of SecTag is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
ACM CCS 2010,Dialog-based payload aggregation for intrusion detection.,"Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) such as Snort or Bro that have to analyze the packet payload for all the received data show severe performance problems if used in high-speed networks. Recent research results improve pattern matchers based on efficient algorithms or using specialized hardware. We approach the problem in a completely different way by considerably reducing the amount of data to be analyzed with only marginal impact on the detection quality. Dialog-based Payload Aggregation (DPA) uses TCP sequence numbers to decide which parts of the payload need to be analyzed by the IDS. Whenever a connection starts, or if the direction of the data transmission between peers changes, we forward the next N bytes of traffic to an attached IDS. All data transferred after the window is discarded. Our analysis using live network traffic and multiple Snort rulesets shows that most of the pattern matches occur at the beginning of connections or directly after direction changes in the data streams. According to our experimental results, our method reduces the data rate to be processed to around 1% in a typical network while retaining more than 98% of all detected events. Assuming a linear relationship between the data rate and processing time of an IDS, this results in a speedup of two magnitudes in the best case."
ACM CCS 2010,BLADE - an attack-agnostic approach for preventing drive-by malware infections.,"Web-based surreptitious malware infections (i.e., drive-by downloads) have become the primary method used to deliver malicious software onto computers across the Internet. To address this threat, we present a browser independent operating system kernel extension designed to eliminate driveby malware installations. The BLADE (Block All Drive-by download Exploits) system asserts that all executable files delivered through browser downloads must result from explicit user consent and transparently redirects every unconsented browser download into a nonexecutable secure zone of disk. BLADE thwarts the ability of browser-based exploits to surreptitiously download and execute malicious content by remapping to the file system only those browser downloads to which a programmatically inferred user-consent is correlated, BLADE provides its protection without explicit knowledge of any exploits and is thus resilient against code obfuscation and zero-day threats that directly contribute to the pervasiveness of today's drive-by malware. We present the design of our BLADE prototype implementation for the Microsoft Windows platform, and report results from as extensive empirical evaluation of its effectiveness on popular browsers. Our evaluation includes multiple versions of IE and Firefox, against 1,934 active malicious URLs, representing a broad spectrum of web-based exploits not plaguing the Internet. BLADE successfully blocked all drive-by malware install attempts with zero false positives and a 3% worst-case performance cost."
ACM CCS 2010,On the soundness of authenticate-then-encrypt - formalizing the malleability of symmetric encryption.,"A communication channel from an honest sender A to an honest receiver B can be described as a system with three interfaces labeled A, B, and E (the adversary), respectively, where the security properties of the channel are characterized by the capabilities provided at the E-interface."
ACM CCS 2010,Protecting location privacy against inference attacks.,"GPS-enabled mobile devices are a quickly growing market and users are starting to share their location information with each other through services such as Google Latitude. Location information, however, is very privacy-sensitive since it can be used to infer activities, preferences, relationships, and other personal information, and thus access to it must be carefully protected. We provide a formal definition of location privacy that incorporates an adversary's ability to predict location and discuss possible implementation of access control mechanisms that satisfy this definition. To support our reasoning, we analyze a preliminary data set to evaluate the accuracy of location prediction."
ACM CCS 2010,Abstraction by set-membership - verifying security protocols and web services with databases.,"The abstraction and over-approximation of protocols and web services by a set of Horn clauses is a very successful method in practice. It has however limitations for protocols and web services that are based on databases of keys, contracts, or even access rights, where revocation is possible, so that the set of true facts does not monotonically grow with state transitions. We extend the scope of these over-approximation methods by defining a new way of abstraction that can handle such databases, and we formally prove that the abstraction is sound. We realize a translator from a convenient specification language to standard Horn clauses and use the verifier ProVerif and the theorem prover SPASS to solve them. We show by a number of examples that this approach is practically feasible for wide variety of verification problems of security protocols and web services"
ACM CCS 2010,Designs to account for trust in social network-based sybil defenses.,"Social network-based Sybil defenses exploit the trust exhibited in social graphs to detect Sybil nodes that disrupt an algorithmic property (i.e., the fast mixing) in these graphs. The performance of these defenses depends on the quality of the algorithmic property and assuming a strong trust model in the underlying graph. While it is natural to think of trust value associated with the social graphs, Sybil defenses have used the social graphs without this consideration. In this paper we study paramagnetic designs to tune the performance of Sybil defenses by accounting for trust in social graphs and modeling the trust as modified random walks. Our designs are motivated by the observed relationship between the algorithmic property required for the defenses to perform well and a hypothesized trust value in the underlying graphs."
ACM CCS 2010,"Secure encounter-based social networks - requirements, challenges, and designs.","In this paper we outline requirements, challenges, and designs for encounter-based mobile social networks, where relationships are based on a temporarily shared location. To illustrate the challenges we examine a recently proposed design, SMILE, against a set of functional and security requirements. We show that SMILE is vulnerable to several attacks such as impersonation, collusion, and privacy breaching, even though it was built with the explicit goal of resisting some of those attacks. With this in mind, we construct a flexible framework for secure mobile social networks, and describe how to use it in order to construct several networks which offer somewhat different security properties. Each of the designs is then examined against the ideal requirements where some are shown to outperform previous work."
ACM CCS 2010,DieHarder - securing the heap.,"Heap-based attacks depend on a combination of memory management error and an exploitable memory allocator. Many allocators include ad hoc countermeasures against particular exploits but their effectiveness against future exploits has been uncertain. This paper presents the first formal treatment of the impact of allocator design on security. It analyzes a range of widely-deployed memory allocators, including those used by Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD, and shows that they remain vulnerable to attack. It them presents DieHarder, a new allocator whose design was guided by this analysis. DieHarder provides the highest degree of security from heap-based attacks of any practical allocator of which we are aware while imposing modest performance overhead. In particular, the Firefox web browser runs as fast with DieHarder as with the Linux allocator."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure online banking on untrusted computers.,"Frauds and attacks for online banking are increasing quickly. The major platform for current online banking, personal computer, has become untrusted especially under malware attacks. In this study, we design a smart card-based solution called secure online banking companion (SOBC) to address this problem. Portability and cost are also highly considered in the design. We have implemented a prototype of the solution on a Java Card simulator, which shows the solution can be implemented easily using current smart card technologies."
ACM CCS 2010,iFriendU - leveraging 3-cliques to enhance infiltration attacks in online social networks.,"Online Social Networks (OSNs) such as Facebook have become ubiquitous in the past few years, counting hundreds of millions of people as members. OSNs allow users to form friendship relationships, join groups, communicate and share information with friends. The tremendous popularity of OSNs has naturally made them an appealing target for privacy compromising attacks. In this abstract we propose a novel attack against tightly knit OSN communities. Such (artificial) communities consist of users that know well each other and that are reluctant to accept other users as friends. Becoming a member of such a community may be only a first milestone for the attacker. Harvesting private information of members of such communities and following up with offline attacks may be the longer term benefit."
ACM CCS 2010,Modeling attacks on physical unclonable functions.,"We show in this paper how several proposed Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) can be broken by numerical modeling attacks. Given a set of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) of a PUF, our attacks construct a computer algorithm which behaves indistinguishably from the original PUF on almost all CRPs. This algorithm can subsequently impersonate the PUF, and can be cloned and distributed arbitrarily. This breaks the security of essentially all applications and protocols that are based on the respective PUF. The PUFs we attacked successfully include standard Arbited PUFs and Ring Oscillator PUFs of arbitrary sizes, and XO Arbiter PUFs, Lightweight Secure PUFs, and Feed-Forward Arbiter PUFs of up to a given size and complexity. Our attacks are based upon various machine learning techniques including Logistic Regression and Evolution Strategies. Our work leads to new design requirements for secure electrical PUFs, and will be useful to PUF designers and attackers alike."
ACM CCS 2010,Worry-free encryption - functional encryption with public keys.,"In this work, we put forward the notion of Worry-Free Encryption. This allows Alice to encrypt confidential information under Bob's public key and send it to him, without having to worry about whether Bob has the authority to actually access this information. This is done by encrypting the message under a hidden access policy that only allows Bob to decrypt if his credentials satisfy the policy. Our notion can be seen as a functional encryption scheme but in a public-key setting. As such, we are able to insist that even if the credential authority is corrupted, it should not be able to compromise the security of any honest user."
ACM CCS 2010,Demonstrating cognitive packet network resilience to worm attacks.,"The need for network stability and reliability has led to the growth of autonomic networks that can provide more stable and more reliable communications via on-line measurement, learning and adaptation. A promising architecture is the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) that rapidly adapts to varying network conditions and user requirements using QoS driven reinforcement learning algorithms that drive the routing control. Contrary to conventional mechanisms, the users rather than the nodes, control the routing by specifying their desired QoS requirements (QoS Goals), such as Minimum Delay, Maximum Bandwidth, Minimum Cost, etc., and the network then routes each user's traffic individually based on their specific needs and on a ""glocal"" view. In CPN the user has the ability to explore the network for its own needs, and evaluate its own impact on the network as a whole and vice-versa, and then take appropriate decisions. CPN routing has been evaluated extensively under normal operating conditions and has proven to be very adaptive to network changes such as congestion. Here we show how CPN can respond and survive to catastrophic node failures caused by the spread of network worms. This survival is based on two complementary approaches that are run concurrently: one the one hand, each user attempts to concurrently and adaptively avoid paths which are infected, and secondly patching algorithms are continuously run to repair the network. Experiments show that this approach assures the stability of network communications throughout the course of an attack."
ACM CCS 2010,Survivable key compromise in software update systems.,"Today's software update systems have little or no defense against key compromise. As a result, key compromises have put millions of software update clients at risk. Here we identify three classes of information whose authenticity and integrity are critical for secure software updates. Analyzing existing software update systems with our framework, we find their ability to communicate this information securely in the event of a key compromise to be weak or nonexistent. We also find that the security problems in current software update systems are compounded by inadequate trust revocation mechanisms. We identify core security principles that allow software update systems to survive key compromise. Using these ideas, we design and implement TUF, a software update framework that increases resilience to key compromise."
ACM CCS 2010,Losing control of the internet - using the data plane to attack the control plane.,"In this work, we introduce the Coordinated Cross Plane Session Termination, or CXPST, attack, a distributed denial of service attack that attacks the control plane of the Internet. CXPST extends previous work that demonstrates a vulnerability in routers that allows an adversary to disconnect a pair of routers using only data plane traffic. By carefully choosing BGP sessions to terminate, CXPST generates a surge of BGP updates that are seen by nearly all core routers on the Internet. This surge of updates surpasses the computational capacity of affected routers, crippling their ability to make routing decisions"
ACM CCS 2010,Size-based scheduling - a recipe for DDOS?,"Internet traffic measurements have shown that the majority of the Internet's flows are short, while a small percentage of the largest flows are responsible for most of the bytes. To exploit this property for performance improvement in routers and Web servers, several studies have proposed size-based schedulings to offer preferential treatment to the shortest flows. In this work, we present analytical and simulation results which confirm that size-based scheduling will ease the task of launching DDOS attacks on the Internet."
ACM CCS 2010,Robusta - taming the native beast of the JVM.,"Java applications often need to incorporate native-code components for efficiency and for reusing legacy code. However, it is well known that the use of native code defeats Java's security model. We describe the design and implementation of Robusta, a complete framework that provides safety and security to native code in Java applications. Starting from software-based fault isolation (SFI), Robusta isolates native code into a sandbox where dynamic linking/loading of libraries in supported and unsafe system modification and confidentiality violations are prevented. It also mediates native system calls according to a security policy by connecting to Java's security manager. Our prototype implementation of Robusta is based onNative Client and OpenJDK. Experiments in this prototype demonstrate Robusta is effective and efficient, with modest runtime overhead on a set of JNI benchmark programs. Robusta can be used to sandbox native libraries used in Java's system classes to prevent attackers from exploiting bugs in the libraries. It can also enable trustworthy execution of mobile Java programs with native libraries. The design of Robusta should also be applicable when other type-safe languages (e.g., C#, Python) want to ensure safe interoperation with native libraries"
ACM CCS 2010,Developing security protocols by refinement.,"We propose a development method for security protocols based on stepwise refinement. Our refinement strategy guides the transformation of abstract security goals into protocols that are secure when operating over an insecure channel controlled by a Dolev-Yao-style intruder. The refinement steps successively introduce local states, an intruder, communication channels with security properties, and cryptographic operations realizing these channels. The abstractions used provide insights on how the protocols work and foster the development of families of protocols sharing a common structure and properties. In contrast to post-hoc verification methods, protocols are developed together with their correctness proofs. We have implemented our method in Isabelle/HOL and used it to develop different entity authentication and key transport protocols."
ACM CCS 2010,In God we trust all others we monitor.,"Modern x86 platforms offer stealth capabilities, that are exploited by rootkits to hide malicious code as shown by the rootkit evolution. Recently, security researchers discovered a very powerful execution environment for rootkits that is isolated from the actual x86 host platform. According to the capabilities of the isolated environment the researches called it ""ring -3"". Security mechanisms, such as antivirus software, cannot reveal ""ring -3"" rootkits, since they are executed in the operating system which makes them unable to access ""ring -3""."
ACM CCS 2010,User-friendly matching protocol for online social networks.,"In this paper, we outline a privacy-preserving matching protocol for OSN (online social network) users to find their potential friends. With the proposed protocol, a logged-in user can match her profile with that of an off-line stranger, while both profiles are maximally protected. Our solution successfully eliminates the requirement of ""out-of-band"" communication channels, which is one of the biggest obstacles facing cryptographic solutions for OSNs."
ACM CCS 2010,An improved algorithm for tor circuit scheduling.,"Tor is a popular anonymity-preserving network, consisting of routers run by volunteers all around the world. It protects Internet users' privacy by relaying their network traffic through a series of routers, thus concealing the linkage between the sender and the recipient. Despite the advantage of Tor's anonymizing capabilities, it also brings extra latency, which discourages more users from joining the network."
ACM CCS 2010,Hierarchical attribute-based encryption for fine-grained access control in cloud storage services.,"Cloud computing, as an emerging computing paradigm, enables users to remotely store their data into a cloud so as to enjoy scalable services on-demand. Especially for small and medium-sized enterprises with limited budgets, they can achieve cost savings and productivity enhancements by using cloud-based services to manage projects, to make collaborations, and the like. However, allowing cloud service providers (CSPs), which are not in the same trusted domains as enterprise users, to take care of confidential data, may raise potential security and privacy issues. To keep the sensitive user data confidential against untrusted CSPs, a natural way is to apply cryptographic approaches, by disclosing decryption keys only to authorized users. However, when enterprise users outsource confidential data for sharing on cloud servers, the adopted encryption system should not only support fine-grained access control, but also provide high performance, full delegation, and scalability, so as to best serve the needs of accessing data anytime and anywhere, delegating within enterprises, and achieving a dynamic set of users. In this paper, we propose a scheme to help enterprises to efficiently share confidential data on cloud servers. We achieve this goal by first combining the hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) system and the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) system, and then making a performance-expressivity tradeoff, finally applying proxy re-encryption and lazy re-encryption to our scheme."
ACM CCS 2010,In search of an anonymous and secure lookup - attacks on structured peer-to-peer anonymous communication systems.,"The ability to locate random relays is a key challenge for peer-to-peer (P2P) anonymous communication systems. Earlier attempts like Salsa and AP3 used distributes hash table lookups to locate relays, but the lack of anonymity in their lookup mechanisms enables an adversary to infer the path structure and compromise used anonymity. NISAN and Torsk are state-of-the-art systems for P2P anonymous communication. Their designs include mechanisms that are specifically tailored to mitigate information leak attacks. NISAN proposes to add anonymity into the lookup mechanism itself, while Torsk proposes the use of secret buddy nodes to anonymize the lookup initiator. In this paper, we attack the key mechanisms that hide the relationship between a lookup initiator and its selected relays in NISAN and Torsk. We present passive attacks on the NISAN lookup and show that it is not as anonymous as previously thought. We analyze three circuit construction mechanisms for anonymous communication using the NISAN lookup, and show that the information leaks in the NISAN lookup lead to a significant reduction in user anonymity. We also propose active attacks on Torsk that defeat its secret buddy mechanism and consequently compromise user anonymity. Our results are backed up by probabilistic modeling and extensive simulations. Our study motivates the search for a DHT lookup mechanism that is both secure and anonymous."
ACM CCS 2010,Secure dynamic code generation against spraying.,"DCG (Dynamic Code Generation) technologies have found widely applications in the Web 2.0 era, Dion Blazakis recently presented a Flash JIT-Spraying attack against Adobe Flash Player that easily circumvented DEP and ASLR protection mechanisms built in modern operating systems. We have generalized and extended JIT Spraying into DCG Spraying. Based our analyses on this abstract model of DCG Spraying, we have found that all mainstream DCG implementations (Java/ JavaScript/ Flash/ .Net/ SilverLight) are vulnerable against DCG Spraying attack, and none of the existing ad hoc defenses such as compilation optimization, random NOP padding and constant splitting provides effective protection. Furthermore, we propose a new protection method, INSeRT, which combines randomization of intrinsic elements of machine instructions and randomly planted special trapping snippets. INSeRT practically renders the ""sprayed code"" ineffective, while alerts the host program of ongoing attacking attempts. We implemented a prototype of INSeRT on the V8 JavaScript engine, and the performance overhead is less than 5%, which should be acceptable in practical application."
ACM CCS 2010,Testing metrics for password creation policies by attacking large sets of revealed passwords.,"In this paper we attempt to determine the effectiveness of using entropy, as defined in NIST SP800-63, as a measurement of the security provided by various password creation policies. This is accomplished by modeling the success rate of current password cracking techniques against real user passwords. These data sets were collected from several different websites, the largest one containing over 32 million passwords. This focus on actual attack methodologies and real user passwords quite possibly makes this one of the largest studies on password security to date. In addition we examine what these results mean for standard password creation policies, such as minimum password length, and character set requirements."
ACM CCS 2010,Security analysis of India&apos;s electronic voting machines.,"Elections in India are conducted almost exclusively using electronic voting machines developed over the past two decades by a pair of government-owned companies. These devices, known in India as EVMs, have been praised for their simple design, ease of use, and reliability, but recently they have also been criticized following widespread reports of election irregularities. Despite this criticism, many details of the machines' design have never been publicly disclosed, and they have not been subjected to a rigorous, independent security evaluation. In this paper, we present a security analysis of a real Indian EVM obtained from an anonymous source. We describe the machine's design and operation in detail, and we evaluate its security in light of relevant election procedures. We conclude that in spite of the machines' simplicity and minimal software trusted computing base, they are vulnerable to serious attacks that can alter election results and violate the secrecy of the ballot. We demonstrate two attacks, implemented using custom hardware, which could be carried out by dishonest election insiders or other criminals with only brief physical access to the machines. This case study carries important lessons for Indian elections and for electronic voting security more generally."
ACM CCS 2010,Mimimorphism - a new approach to binary code obfuscation.,"Binary obfuscation plays an essential role in evading malware static analysis and detection. The widely used code obfuscation techniques, such as polymorphism and metamorphism, focus on evading syntax based detection. However, statistic test and semantic analysis techniques have been developed to thwart their evasion attempts. More recent binary obfuscation techniques are divided in their purposes of attacking either statistical or semantic approach, but not both. In this paper, we introduce mimimorphism, a novel binary obfuscation technique with the potential of evading both statistical and semantic detections. Mimimorphic malware uses instruction-syntax-aware high-order mimic functions to transform its binary into mimicry executables that exhibit high similarity to benign programs in terms of statistical properties and semantic characteristics. We implement a prototype of the mimimorphic engine on the Intel x86 platform, and evaluate its capability of evading statistical anomaly detection and semantic analysis detection techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that the mimicry executables are indistinguishable from benign programs in terms of byte frequency distribution and entropy, as well as control flow fingerprint."
ACM CCS 2010,Ad hoc broadcast encryption.,"Numerous applications in ad hoc networks, peer-to-peer networks, and on-the-fly data sharing call for confidential broadcast without relying on a dealer. To cater for such applications, we propose a new primitive referred to as ad hoc broadcast encryption (AHBE), in which each user possesses a public key and, upon seeing the public keys of the users, a sender can securely broadcast to any subset of them, so that only the intended users can decrypt. We implement a concrete AHBE scheme proven secure under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE) assumption. The resulting scheme has sub-linear complexity, comparable to up-to-date broadcast systems which have also sub-linear complexity but require a fully trusted dealer."
ACM CCS 2010,A control point for reducing root abuse of file-system privileges.,"We address the problem of restricting root's ability to change arbitrary files on disk, in order to prevent abuse on most current desktop operating systems. The approach first involves recognizing and separating out the ability to configure a system from the ability to use the system to perform tasks. The permission to modify configuration of the system is then further subdivided in order to restrict applications from modifying the file-system objects of other applications. We explore the division of root's current ability to change arbitrary files on disk and discuss a prototype that proves out the viability of the approach for designated system-wide file-system objects. Our architecture exposes a control point available for use to enforce policies that prevent one application from modifying another's file-system objects. In addition, we review in detail the permissions given to current installers, and alternative approaches for secure software installation."
ACM CCS 2010,Dynamic window based multihop authentication for WSN.,"Per-hop authentication is the most effective way to prevent DOS attacks during multihop data delivery. Although the study results show that Public Key Cryptography (PKC) is feasible on sensor nodes with limited resources, it is still very expensive to perform per-hop authentication using public key digital signature. To solve the problem that the resources of WSN is exhausted quickly by PKC, Dynamic Window Based Multihop Authentication(DWMA) for WSN is proposed in this paper. Dynamic window makes it possible to pay only a small number of authentication based on digital signature for confining DoS attacks effectively in a small scope and locating suspicious nodes quickly. Experimental results show that DWMA could save more resources than per-hop authentication for WSN, defend DoS attacks effectively and locate malicious nodes. It's an effective protocol for ensuring the resistance of DoS in routing."
ACM CCS 2010,Spectrum based fraud detection in social networks.,"Social networks are vulnerable to various attacks such as spam emails, viral marketing and the such. In this paper we develop a spectrum based detection framework to discover the perpetrators of these attacks. In particular, we focus on Random Link Attacks (RLAs) in which the malicious user creates multiple false identities and interactions among those identities to later proceed to attack the regular members of the network. We show that RLA attackers can be filtered by using their spectral coordinate characteristics, which are hard to hide even after the efforts by the attackers of resembling as much as possible the rest of the network. Experimental results show that our technique is very effective in detecting those attackers and outperforms techniques previously published."
ACM CCS 2010,Practical leakage-resilient pseudorandom generators.,"Cryptographic systems and protocols are the core of many Internet security procedures (such as SSL, SSH, IPSEC, DNSSEC, secure mail, etc.). At the heart of all cryptographic functions is a good source of randomness, and for efficiency, the primitive of pseudorandom generator (PRG). PRG can also be used in the design of stream ciphers, for secure communications. The Internet is nowadays composed of many types of devices with very different hardware and software characteristics. Hence, one of the concerns in such open environments is the information ""leakage"" and its exploitation via the so-called ""side channel attacks""."
ACM CCS 2010,A portable TPM based on USB key.,"Trusted computing technology aims to enhance the security of platform by the TPM. But there are some drawbacks of TCG's Trusted Computing architecture for user-based applications. This paper presents a new concept of portable TPM (PTM) based on USB Key to solve those problems. At first, we use PTM to establish a trusted path between the verifier and the user in remote attestation so as to propagate the trust chain to the end user. Secondly, we design the trust model and platform management mechanism of PTM. In this model the single point failure of TPM and frequent sensitive data migrations between different platforms are avoided based on PTM. At last, we implement the PTM on the USB Key with Java Card Runtime Environment. The test results show that the PTM scheme is feasible for user-based application."
ACM CCS 2010,Sidebuster - automated detection and quantification of side-channel leaks in web application development.,"A web application is a ""two-part"" program, with its components deployed both in the browser and in the web server. The communication between these two components inevitably leaks out the program's internal states to those eavesdropping on its web traffic, simply through the side channel features of the communication such as packet length and timing, even if the traffic is entirely encrypted. Our recent study shows that such side-channel leaks are both fundamental and realistic: a set of popular web applications are found to disclose highly sensitive user data such as one's family incomes, health profiles, investment secrets and more through their side channels. Our study also shows that an significant improvement of the current web-application development practice is necessary to mitigate this threat. To answer this urgent call, we present in this paper a suite of new techniques for automatic detection and quantification of side-channel leaks in web applications. Our approach, called Sidebuster, can automatically analyze an application's source code to detect its side channels and then perform a rerun test to assess the amount of information disclosed through such channels (quantified as the entropy loss). Sidebuster has been designed to work on event-driven applications and can effectively handle the AJAX GUI widgets used in most web applications. In our research, we implemented a prototype of our technique for analyzing GWT applications and evaluated it using complicated web applications. Our study shows that Sidebuster can effectively identify the side-channel leaks in these applications and assess their severity, with a small overhead."
ACM CCS 2010,The security of modern password expiration - an algorithmic framework and empirical analysis.,"This paper presents the first large-scale study of the success of password expiration in meeting its intended purpose, namely revoking access to an account by an attacker who has captured the account's password. Using a dataset of over 7700 accounts, we assess the extent to which passwords that users choose to replace expired ones pose an obstacle to the attacker's continued access. We develop a framework by which an attacker can search for a user's new password from an old one, and design an efficient algorithm to build an approximately optimal search strategy. We then use this strategy to measure the difficulty of breaking newly chosen passwords from old ones. We believe our study calls into question the merit of continuing the practice of password expiration."
ACM CCS 2010,On efficient ciphertext-policy attribute based encryption and broadcast encryption - extended abstract.,"Existing CP-ABE schemes incur very large ciphertext size, which increases linearly with respect to the number of attributes in the access policy. Large ciphertext prevents CP-ABE from being adopted in the communication constrained environments. In this paper, we proposed a new construction of CP-ABE, named Constant-size CP-ABE (denoted as CCP-ABE) that significantly reduces the ciphertext to a constant size for an AND gate access policy with any given number of attributes. Each ciphertext in CCP-ABE requires only elements on a bilinear group."
ACM CCS 2010,Efficient provable data possession for hybrid clouds.,"Provable data possession is a technique for ensuring the integrity of data in outsourcing storage service. In this paper, we propose a cooperative provable data possession scheme in hybrid clouds to support scalability of service and data migration, in which we consider the existence of multiple cloud service providers to cooperatively store and maintain the clients' data. Our experiments show that the verification of our scheme requires a small, constant amount of overhead, which minimizes communication complexity."
ACM CCS 2010,Attacks and design of image recognition CAPTCHAs.,"We systematically study the design of image recognition CAPTCHAs (IRCs) in this paper. We first review and examine all existing IRCs schemes and evaluate each scheme against the practical requirements in CAPTCHA applications, particularly in large-scale real-life applications such as Gmail and Hotmail. Then we present a security analysis of the representative schemes we have identified. For the schemes that remain unbroken, we present our novel attacks. For the schemes for which known attacks are available, we propose a theoretical explanation why those schemes have failed. Next, we provide a simple but novel framework for guiding the design of robust IRCs. Then we propose an innovative IRC called Cortcha that is scalable to meet the requirements of large-scale applications. It relies on recognizing objects by exploiting the surrounding context, a task that humans can perform well but computers cannot. An infinite number of types of objects can be used to generate challenges, which can effectively disable the learning process in machine learning attacks. Cortcha does not require the images in its image database to be labeled. Image collection and CAPTCHA generation can be fully automated. Our usability studies indicate that, compared with Google's text CAPTCHA, Cortcha allows a slightly higher human accuracy rate but on average takes more time to solve a challenge."
ACM CCS 2010,A cloud based SIM DRM scheme for the mobile internet.,"With the rapid growth of the mobile industry, a considerable amount of mobile applications and services are available. Meanwhile, pirates and illegal distributions of digital contents have become serious issues. Digital Rights Management (DRM) aims at protecting digital contents from being abused through regulating the usage of digital contents. In this paper, a cloud based SIM DRM scheme, called CS-DRM, is proposed for the mobile Internet. Also, a prototype of our DRM scheme is implemented to demonstrate the correctness, effectiveness and efficiency of CS-DRM.",
