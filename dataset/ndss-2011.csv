symp2011,Soundcomber: A Stealthy and Context-Aware Sound Trojan for Smartphones,"We explore the threat of smartphone malware with ac-cess to on-board sensors, which opens new avenues for il-licit collection of private information. While existing workshows that such “sensory malware” can convey raw sen-sor data (e.g., video and audio) to a remote server, theseapproaches lack stealthiness, incur significant communica-tion and computation overhead during data transmissionand processing, and can easily be defeated by existing pro-tections like denying installation of applications with ac-cess to both sensitive sensors and the network. We presentSoundcomber, a Trojan with few and innocuous permis-sions, that can extract a small amount of targeted privateinformation from the audio sensor of the phone. Usingtargeted profiles for context-aware analysis, Soundcomberintelligently “pulls out” sensitive data such as credit cardand PIN numbers from both tone- and speech-based inter-action with phone menu systems. Soundcomber performsefficient, stealthy local extraction, thereby greatly reducingthe communication cost for delivering stolen data. Sound-comber automatically infers the destination phone numberby analyzing audio, circumvents known security defenses,and conveys information remotely without direct networkaccess. We also design and implement a defensive architec-ture that foils Soundcomber, identify new covert channelsspecific to smartphones, and provide a video demonstrationof Soundcomber."
symp2011,A Security API for Distributed Social Networks,"We present a cryptographic framework to achieve accesscontrol, privacy of social relations, secrecy of resources,and anonymity of users in social networks. We illustrateour technique on a core API for social networking, whichincludes methods for establishing social relations and forsharing resources. The cryptographic protocols implement-ing these methods use pseudonyms to hide user identi-ties, signatures on these pseudonyms to establish social re-lations, and zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of suchsignatures to demonstrate the existence of social relationswithout sacrificing user anonymity. As we do not put anyconstraints on the underlying social network, our frame-work is generally applicable and, in particular, constitutesan ideal plug-in for decentralized social networks.We analyzed the security of our protocols by developingformal definitions of the aforementioned security propertiesand by verifying them using ProVerif, an automated theo-rem prover for cryptographic protocols. Finally, we built aprototypical implementation and conducted an experimen-tal evaluation to demonstrate the efficiency and the scala-bility of our framework."
symp2011,Location Privacy via Private Proximity Testing,We study privacy-preserving tests for proximity: Alicecan test if she is close to Bob without either party reveal-ing any other information about their location. We describeseveral secure protocols that support private proximity test-ing at various levels of granularity. We study the use of“location tags” generated from the physical environmentin order to strengthen the security of proximity testing. Weimplemented our system on the Android platform and re-port on its effectiveness. Our system uses a social network(Facebook) to manage user public keys.
symp2011,Relay Attacks on Passive Keyless Entry and Start Systems in Modern Cars,"We demonstrate relay attacks on Passive Keyless Entryand Start (PKES) systems used in modern cars. We buildtwo efficient and inexpensive attack realizations, wired andwireless physical-layer relays, that allow the attacker to en-ter and start a car by relaying messages between the carand the smart key. Our relays are completely independentof the modulation, protocol, or presence of strong authenti-cation and encryption. We perform an extensive evaluationon 10 car models from 8 manufacturers. Our results showthat relaying the signal in one direction only (from the carto the key) is sufficient to perform the attack while the truedistance between the key and car remains large (tested upto 50 meters, non line-of-sight). We also show that, withour setup, the smart key can be excited from up to 8 meters.This removes the need for the attacker to get close to thekey in order to establish the relay. We further analyze anddiscuss critical system characteristics. Given the generalityof the relay attack and the number of evaluated systems, itis likely that all PKES systems based on similar designs arealso vulnerable to the same attack. Finally, we propose im-mediate mitigation measures that minimize the risk of relayattacks as well as recent solutions that may prevent relayattacks while preserving the convenience of use, for whichPKES systems were initially introduced."

symp2011,Good Neighbor: Ad hoc Pairing of Nearby Wireless Devices by Multiple Antennas,"The proliferation of personal wireless devices requiressecure connection between them. While it is easy to se-curely pair electronic devices by wires, it is very challeng-ing to pair them wirelessly when they have no prior asso-ciation. We propose Good Neighbor, a novel scheme thatsecurely pairs nearby wireless devices by exploiting mul-tiple antennas built in them. Our scheme requires neithershared secrets nor out-of-band channels (e.g., audio, vi-sual, keyboard, etc.) between the pairing devices. It onlyrequires that the receiver has multiple antennas and thatthe sender can be placed nearby the receiver. Our schemeis based on the propagation characteristic of the wirelesssignal that the power of the received signal is inverselyproportional to some exponent of the distance between thesender and receiver. When a nearby sender moves veryclose to one antenna on the receiver, the receiver can ob-serve a large difference between the signal strength mea-sured on its two antennas, whereas a faraway sender wouldbe unable to induce such a large difference. We validateour scheme through theoretical analysis and experimentalmeasurements. We discuss the factors that may affect ourscheme — including antenna gain, received signal strength(RSS) saturation, dynamic rate adaptation, and multipatheffects — and how to mitigate them. Finally, we demon-strate the practicality of our scheme by implementing andevaluating a prototype."
symp2011,Practical Protection of Kernel Integrity for Commodity OS from Untrusted Extensions,"Kernel extensions are widely used by attackers to com-promise the operating system kernel. With the presence ofvarious untrusted extensions, it remains a challenging prob-lem to comprehensively preserve the integrity of OS kernelsin a practical and generic way. In this paper, we presentHUKO, a hypervisor-based integrity protection system de-signed to protect commodity OS kernels from untrusted ex-tensions. In HUKO system, untrusted kernel extensions cansafely run to provide desired functionalities. The behaviorsof untrusted extensions, however, are confined by manda-tory access control policies, which significantly limit theattacker’s ability to compromise the integrity of the ker-nel. To guarantee multi-aspect protection and enforcement,HUKO leverages hardware assisted paging to transparentlyisolate untrusted extensions from the OS kernel. Moreover,HUKO overcomes the challenge of mediation overhead byintroducing a novel design named subject-aware protectionstate transition to eliminate unnecessary privilege transi-tions caused by mediating allowed accesses. Our approachis practical because it requires little change for either OSkernel or extensions, and it can inherently support multiplecommodity operating systems and legacy extensions. Wehave implemented a prototype of HUKO based on the opensource Xen hypervisor. The evaluation results show thatHUKO can comprehensively protect the integrity for bothLinux and Windows kernel from various kinds of maliciousextensions with an acceptable performance cost."
symp2011,Efficient Monitoring of Untrusted Kernel-Mode Execution,"Recent malware instances execute completely in thekernel as drivers; they do not contain any user-level ma-licious processes. This design evades the system callmonitoring used by many software security solutions, in-cluding malware analyzers and host-based intrusion de-tectors that track only user-level processes. To trace thebehavior of kernel malware instances, we design and im-plement a hypervisor-based system called Gateway thatmonitors kernel APIs invoked by drivers. Gateway cre-ates a hardened, non-bypassable monitoring interfaceby isolating drivers in an address space separate fromthe kernel. To overcome the performance degradationintroduced by switches between these separate addressspaces, our design rewrites binary kernel and drivercode at runtime and generates new code on demand tooptimize the address space transition speed. Our exper-imental measurements show performance overheads of10% or better, with many overheads less than 1%. Oursecurity evaluation shows that Gateway is able to mon-itor all kernel APIs invoked by malicious drivers acrossits non-bypassable interface."
symp2011,SigGraph: Brute Force Scanning of Kernel Data Structure Instances Using Graph-based Signatures,"Brute force scanning of kernel memory images for find-ing kernel data structure instances is an important func-tion in many computer security and forensics applications.Brute force scanning requires effective, robust signatures ofkernel data structures. Existing approaches often use thevalue invariants of certain fields as data structure signa-tures. However, they do not fully exploit the rich points-to relations between kernel data structures. In this pa-per, we show that such points-to relations can be lever-aged to generate graph-based structural invariant signa-tures. More specifically, we develop SigGraph, a frame-work that systematically generates non-isomorphic signa-tures for data structures in an OS kernel. Each signatureis a graph rooted at a subject data structure with its edgesreflecting the points-to relations with other data structures.Our experiments with a range of Linux kernels show thatSigGraph-based signatures achieve high accuracy in recog-nizing kernel data structure instances via brute force scan-ning. We further show that SigGraph achieves better robust-ness against pointer value anomalies and corruptions, with-out requiring global memory mapping and object reachabil-ity. We demonstrate that SigGraph can be applied to kernelmemory forensics, kernel rootkit detection, and kernel ver-sion inference."
symp2011,Losing Control of the Internet: Using the Data Plane to Attack the Control Plane,"In this work, we introduce the Coordinated Cross PlaneSession Termination, or CXPST, attack, a distributed denialof service attack that attacks the control plane of the In-ternet. CXPST extends previous work that demonstrates avulnerability in routers that allows an adversary to discon-nect a pair of routers using only data plane traffic. By care-fully choosing BGP sessions to terminate, CXPST generatesa surge of BGP updates that are seen by nearly all corerouters on the Internet. This surge of updates surpasses thecomputational capacity of affected routers, crippling theirability to make routing decisions.In this paper we show how an adversary can attack mul-tiple BGP sessions simultaneously and measure the impactthese session failures have on the control plane of the In-ternet. We directly simulate the BGP activity resulting fromthis attack and compute the impact those messages have onrouter processing loads. Through simulations we show thatbotnets on the order of 250, 000 nodes can increase process-ing delays from orders of microseconds to orders of hours.We also propose and validate a defense against CXPST.Through simulation we demonstrate that current defensesare insufficient to stop CXPST. We propose an alternative,low cost, defense that is successful against CXPST, even ifonly the top 10% of Autonomous Systems by degree deployit. Additionally, we consider more long term defenses thatstop not only CXPST, but similar attacks as well."
symp2011,EXPOSURE: Finding Malicious Domains Using Passive DNS Analysis,"The domain name service (DNS) plays an important rolein the operation of the Internet, providing a two-way map-ping between domain names and their numerical identifiers.Given its fundamental role, it is not surprising that a widevariety of malicious activities involve the domain name ser-vice in one way or another. For example, bots resolve DNSnames to locate their command and control servers, andspam mails contain URLs that link to domains that resolveto scam servers. Thus, it seems beneficial to monitor theuse of the DNS system for signs that indicate that a certainname is used as part of a malicious operation.In this paper, we introduce EXPOSURE, a system thatemploys large-scale, passive DNS analysis techniques todetect domains that are involved in malicious activity. Weuse 15 features that we extract from the DNS traffic that al-low us to characterize different properties of DNS namesand the ways that they are queried.Our experiments with a large, real-world data set con-sisting of 100 billion DNS requests, and a real-life deploy-ment for two weeks in an ISP show that our approach isscalable and that we are able to automatically identify un-known malicious domains that are misused in a variety ofmalicious activity (such as for botnet command and control,spamming, and phishing)."
symp2011,Howard: A Dynamic Excavator for Reverse Engineering Data Structures,"Even the most advanced reverse engineering techniquesand products are weak in recovering data structures instripped binaries—binaries without symbol tables. Unfor-tunately, forensics and reverse engineering without datastructures is exceedingly hard. We present a new solution,known as Howard, to extract data structures from C binarieswithout any need for symbol tables. Our results are signifi-cantly more accurate than those of previous methods — suf-ficiently so to allow us to generate our own (partial) symboltables without access to source code. Thus, debugging suchbinaries becomes feasible and reverse engineering becomessimpler. Also, we show that we can protect existing binariesfrom popular memory corruption attacks, without access tosource code. Unlike most existing tools, our system uses dy-namic analysis (on a QEMU-based emulator) and detectsdata structures by tracking how a program uses memory."
symp2011,No Loitering: Exploiting Lingering Vulnerabilities in Default COM Objects,"The Component Object Model (COM) facilitates thecreation of software plugins for applications running inMicrosoft Windows. ActiveX is a common instantiationof this infrastructure, and uses COM to create pluginsfor Internet Explorer. As vulnerabilities in COM ob-jects included in the installation of Windows have beenfound, Microsoft has responded by blacklisting their useby specific applications. In this paper, we demonstratethat the defense mechanisms protecting vulnerable COMobjects can be easily circumvented. Specifically, our at-tack exploits systemic transitive trust among COM ob-jects and allows for the instantiation and exploitationof any of several hundred known flawed controls. Afterdemonstrating this weakness on fully patched WindowsXP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 machines, we designand implement a system-wide enforcement architecturecalled COMBlocker, which checks the instantiation ofCOM objects against a global policy. We then show thatCOMBlocker is an effective mitigation for such attackswhile imposing minimal overhead (approximately 0.5msper policy check). In so doing, our techniques make theexploitation of default COM objects significantly moredifficult."
symp2011,TIE: Principled Reverse Engineering of Types in Binary Programs,"A recurring problem in security is reverse engineeringbinary code to recover high-level language data abstrac-tions and types. High-level programming languages havedata abstractions such as buffers, structures, and local vari-ables that all help programmers and program analyses rea-son about programs in a scalable manner. During compi-lation, these abstractions are removed as code is translateddown to operations on registers and one globally addressedmemory region. Reverse engineering consists of “undoing”the compilation to recover high-level information so thatprogrammers, security professionals, and analyses can allmore easily reason about the binary code.In this paper we develop novel techniques for reverseengineering data type abstractions from binary programs.At the heart of our approach is a novel type reconstructionsystem based upon binary code analysis. Our techniquesand system can be applied as part of both static or dynamicanalysis, thus are extensible to a large number of securitysettings. Our results on 87 programs show that TIE is bothmore accurate and more precise at recovering high-leveltypes than existing mechanisms."
symp2011,AEG: Automatic Exploit Generation,"The automatic exploit generation challenge is givena program, automatically find vulnerabilities and gener-ate exploits for them. In this paper we present AEG, thefirst end-to-end system for fully automatic exploit gener-ation. We used AEG to analyze 14 open-source projectsand successfully generated 16 control flow hijacking ex-ploits. Two of the generated exploits (expect-5.43 andhtget-0.93) are zero-day exploits against unknown vul-nerabilities. Our contributions are: 1) we show howexploit generation for control flow hijack attacks can bemodeled as a formal verification problem, 2) we pro-pose preconditioned symbolic execution, a novel tech-nique for targeting symbolic execution, 3) we present ageneral approach for generating working exploits oncea bug is found, and 4) we build the first end-to-end sys-tem that automatically finds vulnerabilities and gener-ates exploits that produce a shell."
symp2011,Automated Discovery of Parameter Pollution Vulnerabilities in Web Applications,"In the last twenty years, web applications have grownfrom simple, static pages to complex, full-fledged dynamicapplications. Typically, these applications are built usingheterogeneous technologies and consist of code that runsboth on the client and on the server. Even simple web ap-plications today may accept and process hundreds of dif-ferent HTTP parameters to be able to provide users withinteractive services. While injection vulnerabilities such asSQL injection and cross-site scripting are well-known andhave been intensively studied by the research community, anew class of injection vulnerabilities called HTTP Parame-ter Pollution (HPP) has not received as much attention. Ifa web application does not properly sanitize the user inputfor parameter delimiters, exploiting an HPP vulnerability,an attacker can compromise the logic of the application toperform either client-side or server-side attacks.In this paper, we present the first automated approach forthe discovery of HTTP Parameter Pollution vulnerabilitiesin web applications. Using our prototype implementationcalled PAPAS (PArameter Pollution Analysis System), weconducted a large-scale analysis of more than 5,000 pop-ular websites. Our experimental results show that about30% of the websites that we analyzed contain vulnerableparameters and that 46.8% of the vulnerabilities we discov-ered (i.e., 14% of the total websites) can be exploited viaHPP attacks. The fact that PAPAS was able to find vulnera-bilities in many high-profile, well-known websites suggeststhat many developers are not aware of the HPP problem.We informed a number of major websites about the vulner-abilities we identified, and our findings were confirmed."
symp2011,WebShield: Enabling Various Web Defense Techniques without Client Side Modifications,"Today, web attacks are increasing in frequency, sever-ity and sophistication. Existing solutions are either host-based which suffer deployment problems or middlebox ap-proaches that can only accommodate certain security pro-tection mechanisms with limited protection. In this paper,we propose four design principles for general middleboxframeworks of web protection, and apply these principles todesign WebShield, which can enable various host-based se-curity mechanisms. In particular, we run all the JavaScriptfrom remote web servers only at shadow browser instancesinside the middlebox, and only run our trusted JavaScriptrendering agent at client browsers. The trusted renderingagent turns browsers into a thin web terminal by recon-structing the encoded DOM of a webpage.We implement a prototype of WebShield. Evaluationdemonstrates that a general JavaScript rendering agentcan render webpages precisely and be just slightly slowerthan direct access. We further demonstrate that our designcan work well with interactive web applications such asJavaScript games. WebShield can detect attacks deeply em-bedded in dynamic HTML pages including the ones in com-plex Web 2.0 applications, and can also detect both knownand unknown vulnerabilities. We further show that Web-Shield is scalable for deployment."
symp2011,HTTPOS: Sealing Information Leaks with Browser-side Obfuscation of Encrypted Flows,"Leakage of private information from web applications—even when the traffic is encrypted—is a major securitythreat to many applications that use HTTP for data deliv-ery. This paper considers the problem of inferring from en-crypted HTTP traffic the web sites or web pages visited bya user. Existing browser-side approaches to this problemcannot defend against more advanced attacks, and server-side approaches usually require modifications to web enti-ties, such as browsers, servers, or web objects. In this paper,we propose a novel browser-side system, namely HTTPOS,to prevent information leaks and offer much better scalabil-ity and flexibility. HTTPOS provides a comprehensive andconfigurable suite of traffic transformation techniques fora browser to defeat traffic analysis without requiring anyserver-side modifications. Extensive evaluation of HTTPOSon live web traffic shows that it can successfully prevent thestate-of-the-art attacks from inferring private informationfrom encrypted HTTP flows."
symp2011,Accurate and Provably Secure Latency Estimation with Treeple,"A network latency estimation scheme associates a short“position string” to each peer in a distributed systemso that the latency between any two peers can be esti-mated given only their positions. Proposed applicationsfor these schemes have included efficient overlay construc-tion, compact routing, anonymous route selection, and effi-cient byzantine agreement. This paper introduces Treeple,a new scheme for latency estimation, that differs from pre-vious schemes in several respects. First, Treeple is provablysecure in a strong sense, rather than being designed onlyto resist known attacks. Second, Treeple “positions” arenot based on Euclidean coordinates, but reflect the under-lying network topology. Third, Treeple positions are highlystable, allowing peers to retain the same position informa-tion for long periods with no maintenance. Finally, Treeplepositions can be assigned to peers that do not participatedirectly in the scheme. We evaluate Treeple on a large in-ternet dataset (with over 200,000 measurements) and findthat on average, its latency estimates are within 26% of thetrue round-trip time. By comparison, Vivaldi, a popular butinsecure scheme, has a median relative error of 25% on thesame dataset."
symp2011,"On Measuring the Similarity of Network Hosts: Pitfalls, New Metrics, and Empirical Analyses","As the scope and scale of network data grows, se-curity practitioners and network operators are increas-ingly turning to automated data analysis methods to ex-tract meaningful information. Underpinning these meth-ods are distance metrics that represent the similarity be-tween two values or objects. In this paper, we arguethat many of the obvious distance metrics used to mea-sure behavioral similarity among network hosts fail tocapture the semantic meaning imbued by network pro-tocols. Furthermore, they also tend to ignore long-termtemporal structure of the objects being measured. To ex-plore the role of these semantic and temporal character-istics, we develop a new behavioral distance metric fornetwork hosts and compare its performance to a met-ric that ignores such information. Specifically, we pro-pose semantically meaningful metrics for common datatypes found within network data, show how these met-rics can be combined to treat network data as a unifiedmetric space, and describe a temporal sequencing algo-rithm that captures long-term causal relationships. Indoing so, we bring to light several challenges inherentin defining behavioral metrics for network data, and putforth a new way of approaching network data analysisproblems. Our proposed metric is empirically evaluatedon a dataset of over 30 million network flows, with re-sults that underscore the utility of a holistic approach tonetwork data analysis."
symp2011,SWIRL: A Scalable Watermark to Detect Correlated Network Flows,"Flow watermarks are active traffic analysis techniquesthat help establish a causal connection between two net-work flows by content-independent manipulations, e.g., al-tering packet timings. Watermarks provide a much morescalable approach for flow correlation than passive trafficanalysis. Previous designs of scalable watermarks, how-ever, were subject to multi-flow attacks. They also intro-duced delays too large to be used in most environments.We design SWIRL, a Scalable Watermark that is Invisi-ble and Resilient to packet Losses. SWIRL is the first water-mark that is practical to use for large-scale traffic analysis.SWIRL uses a flow-dependent approach to resist multi-flowattacks, marking each flow with a different pattern. SWIRLis robust to packet losses and network jitter, yet it intro-duces only small delays that are invisible to both benignusers and determined adversaries. We analyze the perfor-mance of SWIRL both analytically and on the PlanetLabtestbed, demonstrating very low error rates. We considerapplications of SWIRL to stepping stone detection and link-ing anonymous communication. We also propose a novelapplication of watermarks to defend against congestion at-tacks on Tor."
symp2011,SPARE: Replicas on Hold,"Despite numerous improvements in the development andmaintenance of software, bugs and security holes exist in to-day’s products, and malicious intrusions happen frequently.While this is a general problem, it explicitly applies to web-based services. However, Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT)replication and proactive recovery offer a powerful com-bination to tolerate and overcome these kinds of faults,thereby enabling long-term service provision. BFT replica-tion is commonly associated with the overhead of 3f + 1replicas to handle f faults. Using a trusted component,some previous systems were able to reduce the resource costto 2f +1 replicas. In general, adding support for proactiverecovery further increases the resource demand. We believethis enormous resource demand is one of the key reasonswhy BFT replication is not commonly applied and consid-ered unsuitable for web-based services.In this paper we present SPARE, a cloud-aware ap-proach that harnesses virtualization to reduce the resourcedemand of BFT replication and to provide efficient supportfor proactive recovery. In SPARE, we focus on the mainsource of software bugs and intrusions; that is, the servicesand their associated execution environments. This approachenables us to restrict replication and request execution toonly f + 1 replicas in the fault-free case while rapidly acti-vating up to f additional replicas by utilizing virtualizationin case of timing violations and faults. For an instant reac-tion, we keep spare replicas that are periodically updatedin a paused state. In the fault-free case, these passive repli-cas require far less resources than active replicas and aidefficient proactive recovery."
symp2011,Efficient Privacy-Preserving Biometric Identification,"We present an efficient matching protocol that can be usedin many privacy-preserving biometric identification systemsin the semi-honest setting. Our most general technical con-tribution is a new backtracking protocol that uses the by-product of evaluating a garbled circuit to enable efficientoblivious information retrieval. We also present a more ef-ficient protocol for computing the Euclidean distances ofvectors, and optimized circuits for finding the closest matchbetween a point held by one party and a set of points heldby another. We evaluate our protocols by implementing apractical privacy-preserving fingerprint matching system.1"
symp2011,Usability Testing a Malware-Resistant Input Mechanism,"We report the results of a usability study of Bumpy, asystem that enables a user to provide secret inputs to re-mote webservers without trusting the computer on whichshe types those inputs. Achieving this somewhat paradoxi-cal property via Bumpy requires extra diligence from users,raising questions as to whether it is a viable protectionfor the average user. We evaluate the originally proposedBumpy design and several new alternatives in a user studyinvolving 85 participants, each of whom utilized one ofthese designs (or a control design) for roughly four monthsto protect her password entries to a university course webpage. Beyond assessing the usability of Bumpy designs, ourstudy offers insights for designing security-relevant inter-faces and training users to successfully utilize them."
symp2011,Tracker: Security and Privacy for RFID-based Supply Chains,"The counterfeiting of pharmaceutics or luxury objects isa major threat to supply chains today. As different facili-ties of a supply chain are distributed and difficult to mon-itor, malicious adversaries can inject fake objects into thesupply chain. This paper presents TRACKER, a protocolfor object genuineness verification in RFID-based supplychains. More precisely, TRACKER allows to securely iden-tify which (legitimate) path an object/tag has taken througha supply chain. TRACKER provides privacy: an adversarycan neither learn details about an object’s path, nor canit trace and link objects in the supply chain. TRACKER’ssecurity and privacy is based on an extension of polyno-mial signature techniques for run-time fault detection usinghomomorphic encryption. Contrary to related work, RFIDtags in this paper are not required to perform any computa-tion, but only feature a few bytes of storage such as ordinaryEPC Class 1 Gen 2 tags."
symp2011,PiOS: Detecting Privacy Leaks in iOS Applications,"With the introduction of Apple’s iOS and Google’s An-droid operating systems, the sales of smartphones have ex-ploded. These smartphones have become powerful devicesthat are basically miniature versions of personal comput-ers. However, the growing popularity and sophistication ofsmartphones have also increased concerns about the pri-vacy of users who operate these devices. These concernshave been exacerbated by the fact that it has become in-creasingly easy for users to install and execute third-partyapplications. To protect its users from malicious applica-tions, Apple has introduced a vetting process. This vet-ting process should ensure that all applications conform toApple’s (privacy) rules before they can be offered via theApp Store. Unfortunately, this vetting process is not well-documented, and there have been cases where maliciousapplications had to be removed from the App Store afteruser complaints.In this paper, we study the privacy threats that applica-tions, written for Apple’s iOS, pose to users. To this end,we present a novel approach and a tool, PiOS, that allowus to analyze programs for possible leaks of sensitive in-formation from a mobile device to third parties. PiOS usesstatic analysis to detect data flows in Mach-0 binaries, com-piled from Objective-C code. This is a challenging task dueto the way in which Objective-C method calls are imple-mented. We have analyzed more than 1,400 iPhone appli-cations. Our experiments show that, with the exception of afew bad apples, most applications respect personal identifi-able information stored on user’s devices. This is even truefor applications that are hosted on an unofficial repository(Cydia) and that only run on jailbroken phones. However,we found that more than half of the applications surrepti-tiously leak the unique ID of the device they are running on.This allows third-parties to create detailed profiles of users’application preferences and usage patterns."
symp2011,Privacy-Preserving Aggregation of Time-Series Data,"We consider how an untrusted data aggregator canlearn desired statistics over multiple participants’ data,without compromising each individual’s privacy. Wepropose a construction that allows a group of partici-pants to periodically upload encrypted values to a dataaggregator, such that the aggregator is able to computethe sum of all participants’ values in every time period,but is unable to learn anything else. We achieve strongprivacy guarantees using two main techniques. First, weshow how to utilize applied cryptographic techniques toallow the aggregator to decrypt the sum from multipleciphertexts encrypted under different user keys. Second,we describe a distributed data randomization procedurethat guarantees the differential privacy of the outcomestatistic, even when a subset of participants might becompromised.1"
